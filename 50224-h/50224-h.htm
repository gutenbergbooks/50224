<br /><span class="small">GOOD LUCK</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Honest Injun, Hugh, I never wanted to
go anywhere half so much as I do right now
to drop in at that State camp where the militia
has started mobilizing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, Bud, and, to tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m
feeling the same way myself. Ever since we
scouts waved good-bye to our gallant Battery
K some five miles up the road, and watched
the last gun, caisson and supply wagon disappear
over the crown of Kettledrum Hill, I&rsquo;ve
had that picture in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I wager things are just <i>humming</i>
over at that same camp, Hugh,&rdquo; sighed the
first boy in faded khaki, &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; Morgan by
name, and a member of Oakvale&rsquo;s famous Boy
Scout Troop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly must be,&rdquo; admitted his comrade,
who wore the insignia of rank that marks
not only a patrol leader, but an assistant scout
master as well. &ldquo;This morning&rsquo;s paper says
that besides our fellows, there is a full regiment
already in camp, not to mention other
commands, such as the Engineers&rsquo;, Signal
Corps and Red Cross detachments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to count the Aviation Squad,
Hugh,&rdquo; added Bud, eagerly. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m
head over ears interested in the birdmen and
their doings, as well as in signaling, surveying
and inventions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it certainly must be a glorious sight,&rdquo;
Hugh said enviously. &ldquo;To tell you the truth,
old fellow, I&rsquo;m lying awake nights trying to
think up some reasonable excuse for paying a
flying visit to the concentration camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; remarked Bud, brightening up a
little, &ldquo;we can squeeze some satisfaction out
of the fact that the scouts had a heap to do
with getting Battery K off to the camp with
their roster on a full war footing.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve undertaken an all-summer job helping
to run the Pastor farm for the crippled
old man, so his boy, Corporal Tony, could go
to the Mexican border with his company.
That&rsquo;s one way scouts can help Uncle Sam
when trouble comes along. It&rsquo;s partly on account
of that promise I&rsquo;m holding back about
leaving Oakvale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! so far as that goes, Hugh,&rdquo; said Bud,
slyly, after the manner of a tempter, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
got the programme all laid out, and Alec Sands
could take your place for a week. The site
for the camp we expect to start up there near
the Pastor farm has been arranged, so the boys
would make the hike, and then be handy in
getting the hay crop cut, and have it taken to
the barn inside of ten days. If you took a
notion, Hugh, don&rsquo;t you think the two of us
might manage to get away? Try hard and
think up some good excuse for making the
trip. A dozen people here in Oakvale would
want to send messages and packages to their
boys, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh Hardin laughed at the entreating
manner of his companion. They were standing
at the time in front of the post office building,
where people kept coming and going in
squads and singly, for that was one of the
busiest places in the mill town of Oakvale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Hugh and Bud both belonged to the <i>Wolf</i>
Patrol of the troop, which was in a most flourishing
condition, having four full patrols, and
another well along. These enterprising lads
of Oakvale had been more or less in the limelight
for several seasons past. Circumstances
had allowed them to engineer quite a number
of really successful enterprises that were one
and all to their credit. Those readers who
may be only making their acquaintance with
Hugh and his friends in this story, if at all
curious to know what some of those stirring
adventures were, should secure previous volumes
in this series, and enjoy reading accounts
of scout activities as related therein.</p>
<p>One thing certain, those same enterprising
and ambitious scouts had succeeded in convincing
the most skeptical persons that the
coming to town of such an organization had
been the means of a regeneration among the
boys of Oakvale. Many things had been tolerated
under the old order, with the familiar
excuse that &ldquo;boys will be boys, and you must
expect them to play practical pranks, and do
all manner of shocking things in order to work
off their extra enthusiasm,&rdquo; but such outbreaks
were quite unknown in these later days.
The reason was that a new means for allowing
the high-spirited lads to &ldquo;let off steam&rdquo;
had been found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>On the morning the call of the President
came summoning the National Guard to
mobilize, with a view to being sworn into the
service of the Government, so as to proceed
forthwith to the Mexican border, and guard
the same against aggression, it sent a thrill
across the entire country from the Atlantic to
the Pacific.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of young fellows flocked
to the armories, and the most intense excitement
followed, as hurried preparations were
started looking toward increasing these various
military organizations from a peace to a
war footing.</p>
<p>Oakvale had a battery of four guns, together
with such equipment as was necessary for
utilizing these field pieces; but just then it
happened, as in many similar organizations,
that the roster contained just enough names
to prevent the company from being disbanded
under the law by the State authorities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Consequently a feverish hunt began to enlist
new units, or, what was better yet, former
members who had left the ranks to sign
again, so as to swell the number to a high level
of which the town might be proud.</p>
<p>In this little drama it chanced that Hugh
and his fellow scouts bore themselves right
handsomely, so that it was chiefly owing to
their manly efforts that a number of former
members came forward again to put their
names down.</p>
<p>After a very eventful period of preparation,
which lasted for several days, Battery K
had started for the mobilization camp. As
connections on the railroad did not happen to
favor them, they concluded to make the trip
overland, knowing that it would take less than
two full days, and must prove of considerable
benefit to both men and horses in the way of
practice, which they greatly needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Once more Oakvale had settled down to the
humdrum monotony of customary life. Things
resumed their former conditions, but after the
feverish outburst of patriotism people found
it difficult to attend to business. They missed
the faces of those gallant young fellows who
had gone to serve their country. So, too, they
found things terribly dull after all that exhilarating
music which the fine Oakvale brass
band had provided while the battery lay encamped
on the grass-covered public square.
They missed the enlisting officers&rsquo; tent, surrounded
day and evening by a curious throng,
where the khaki-clad men urged their friends
to sign the muster roll so as to bring the local
company up to a war footing.</p>
<p>Some of the boys had been inconsolable ever
since they watched the last of the troop vanish
over the hill, as Hugh had described. Being
ambitious and patriotic lads, they would have
liked nothing better than a chance to accompany
those artillerymen to camp, and even to
the far distant Southwest border where the
followers of the Mexican bandit, Villa, were
threatening further bold raids across the international
line.</p>
<p>Never dreaming of having their ardent
wishes suddenly realized, the two boys continued
to stand there, chatting of scout affairs
in general, and what they expected to do while
in camp in particular. Bud, upon turning his
head, discovered something which he communicated
to Hugh in his breezy fashion:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I miss my guess, Hugh, we&rsquo;re going
to hear some news worth while. There&rsquo;s
our comrade, Blake Merton, heading this way
like a schooner with all sails set. He looks
considerably worked up, too. I wonder what
ails him? Perhaps something&rsquo;s happened to
keep him from joining the bunch when we
start on our hike tomorrow for that camp up
near the Pastor farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh, taking a look, remarked calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know what&rsquo;s up, for he&rsquo;s heading
our way, and making signals that he wants
us to wait for him. I hope it hasn&rsquo;t anything
to do with that case of scarlet fever my
folks were talking about this morning, because
it happens that the Werner house is close to
where Blake lives. If one of his younger
sisters came down with the disease they&rsquo;d have
to quarantine the Mertons, and so Blake
couldn&rsquo;t go with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wee whiz! that <i>would</i> be tough luck&mdash;with
vacation just starting in!&rdquo; the sympathetic Bud
went on to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Hugh!&rdquo; remarked the newcomer as
he arrived, partly out of breath from hurrying
so fast, and looking excited as well, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
searching for you all over town. They put
me on several false scents, but I&rsquo;m awful glad
to find you at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, Blake?&rdquo; asked the patrol
leader; for, although the Merton boy belonged
to the <i>Hawk</i> Patrol, somehow, when he
wanted counsel and advice, he turned to the
assistant scout master rather than to Walter
Osborne, who was the <i>Hawk</i> leader.</p>
<p>Blake glanced toward Bud, and then, as
though making up his mind, quickly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Bud can be depended on to keep
a secret as tight as a drum, and so I&rsquo;m going
to speak up. Fact is, Hugh, I&rsquo;m in a peck of
trouble about my cousin, Felix Platt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I remember that he went away with
the battery, being a member of the same,&rdquo;
Hugh observed. &ldquo;What ails Felix? Has his
mother fallen sick, and ought he come home
again before being mustered into Uncle Sam&rsquo;s
service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake Merton shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t that, Hugh, worse than that,
even, I should say!&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got us worked up, all right,
Blake,&rdquo; exclaimed Bud, feverishly, &ldquo;so please
explain what you mean when you say that. I
hope your cousin hasn&rsquo;t gone and done something
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s made a fool of himself, I&rsquo;m sorry to
say, and stands a good chance of losing all
his uncle&rsquo;s property. You must know that
Uncle Reuben is his guardian as well, and has
made his will in favor of Felix, so as to cut off
that bad son of his who disgraced him several
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know all about what Luther Gregory
has done to worry his father,&rdquo; admitted
Bud, encouragingly. &ldquo;But Reuben isn&rsquo;t any
blood relation of yours, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, though Felix happens to be my second
cousin. You see, they had some warm
words the night before the battery left town,
and Felix, being a hot-blooded young fellow,
said something he shouldn&rsquo;t, and which has
cut Uncle Reuben to the quick. Just this
morning the old gentleman had his lawyer,
Judge Marshall, to change his will once more,
cutting off Felix. The good old judge managed
to coax him to wait a bit; and so Uncle
Reuben has vowed that if he doesn&rsquo;t receive
an apology from Felix by sundown of tomorrow,
nothing will keep him from doing as he
threatens, much as he has cared for the boy
since his own son failed him. Yes, he threatens
to leave every dollar of his big fortune to
charity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; mused Hugh, shaking his
head, for he had always liked Felix, who was
a pretty fine sort of a young chap, as they go
in these days. &ldquo;But how is it you come to
know about this matter, Blake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this way, Hugh,&rdquo; came the ready reply.
&ldquo;Uncle Reuben made Judge Marshall
promise that he wouldn&rsquo;t communicate with
Felix, or send him any direct word; but, having
the best interests of all parties at stake,
and, believing the old man would secretly applaud
his action if ever he knew it, the judge
called to me over the wire to drop in right
away and see him. Then he told me about it,
not suggesting a single thing, mind you, but
leaving it up to me to do what I thought best,
because he knew how fond of Felix I&rsquo;ve always
been.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Hugh, beaming on him,
&ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you get busy, and write Felix a
letter right away, explaining the case, and begging
him to send the apology? By now he&rsquo;s
cooled down, and ten chances to one is mighty
sorry for speaking as he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, I thought of that the first thing,
but what if the letter didn&rsquo;t reach him?&rdquo; objected
Blake, frowning as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could register it, or send with a quick
delivery stamp,&rdquo; remarked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then there would always be a lot of
uncertainty about it,&rdquo; continued the other,
stubbornly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently, then, you&rsquo;ve got some other
dandy scheme up your sleeve!&rdquo; exclaimed Bud,
suspiciously. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear about it, Blake, if
you need any advice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve always believed that when you
want anything done, the only safe way is to do
it yourself. You remember the bird telling
her young ones in the nest that so long as the
farmer depended on his relatives and friends
to help cut the wheat there was no need for
worry; but when finally he told his son they&rsquo;d
start in and do the job themselves the mother
bird admitted it was time for flitting. Now,
Hugh, I&rsquo;ve got a hunch that if only you&rsquo;d go
along with me to give advice, I&rsquo;d make a start
for the mobilization camp right away, and tell
Felix face to face what a fool he has been, as
well as fetch back a letter for Uncle Reuben
that would heal all the bitter feelings in the
old gentleman&rsquo;s heart. What do you say to
that, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">A BREAKDOWN ON THE ROAD</span></h2>
<p>Hugh and Bud exchanged glances, and then
the latter burst into a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blake, bless your heart, of course Hugh
will be glad to go along with you over to the
big State camp so you can tell Felix what a
silly he&rsquo;s made of himself. You know, scouts
are always ready to perform a good deed, and
bringing Uncle Reuben and his favorite
nephew together again would be just bully.
And, say, you&rsquo;ve got to count me in the deal,
ditto, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know just how that might
be?&rdquo; stammered Blake; when energetic Bud
broke in upon him with a vigor that would
brook no refusal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you several reasons for my going
along, Blake,&rdquo; he said, tapping one finger after
another. &ldquo;First off, it happens that Hugh and
myself were just saying we only wanted some
half-way decent excuse for deserting the other
fellows right now, and heading straight for
the big camp. Then, secondly, I c&rsquo;n get a sort
of decent old car in which we could make the
run, if nothing happened to ditch us on the
road. Then, last, but far from least, I want to
go! And that settles it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Bud,&rdquo; agreed the other, carried
away by this enthusiasm and desire to serve
a comrade in trouble, &ldquo;what you say goes.
That idea about the car is a good one. Hugh,
you haven&rsquo;t told me what you think yet; please
help me out of this pickle, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! just as Bud here remarked,&rdquo; laughed
the patrol leader. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like a hungry fish biting
at the first baited hook I see ahead of me.
I certainly do want to go over to that mobilization
camp the worst way, and the only thing
that kept me from starting was the want of a
decent excuse. Now that a comrade has called
on me to assist him, there&rsquo;s no further reason
for holding back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Hugh!&rdquo; exclaimed Bud
Morgan, beaming happily on his two comrades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just knew I could depend on you to help
me tide over this trouble, Hugh,&rdquo; said Blake,
grasping the other&rsquo;s hand, and squeezing it
warmly. &ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;ve got all that fixed,
let&rsquo;s make the necessary arrangements as soon
as we can; time counts in a game like this; and,
besides, I&rsquo;ve got certain reasons for fearing
there may be interruptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not choose to enter into any explanation
for these rather strange words, seeing
which Hugh presently went on to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get in touch with Alec Sands, the leader
of the <i>Otters</i>, and tell him that he must take
charge of things for some days while I&rsquo;m away.
Alec can see about the hike tomorrow; making
camp up there near the Pastor farm; and even
starting in at the hay-cutting if we&rsquo;re not back
in time. Fortunately, Alec knows considerable
along the line of farm work; and then,
too, old Mr. Pastor can coach the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Hugh, please don&rsquo;t drop a hint about
why you&rsquo;ve got to go over to the big camp,&rdquo;
pleaded Blake. &ldquo;You see, it might happen to
get to the ears of Uncle Reuben, and offend
him. That&rsquo;s got to be a dead secret between
the three of us until I can put a letter from
Felix in his guardian&rsquo;s hand, and know the old
gentleman&rsquo;s really forgiven him for his hasty
words.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll both shake hands with you on that,
Blake,&rdquo; said Hugh, wishing to make sure that
Bud would be willing to take the same vow of
secrecy on himself.</p>
<p>When this operation had been completed,
Blake appeared to be much relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you expect it will take you
to see Alec, and arrange other things, Hugh?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the patrol leader immediately replied,
&ldquo;so far as that goes, I believe an hour ought
to cover everything, such as telling my folks
at home, and getting Alec to take charge. How
about you two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do it in far less time,&rdquo; admitted
Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here, unless the old car has to be
fixed in some way. Generally the tires aren&rsquo;t
holding any too well,&rdquo; explained Bud. &ldquo;But,
then, a fellow mustn&rsquo;t look a gift horse in the
mouth; all it&rsquo;ll cost us is the gas and lubricating
oil. We c&rsquo;n fix that up among us easy
enough, eh, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>So it was agreed that they should rendezvous
at a certain spot as soon as possible. If
Hugh could accomplish his several errands in
any shorter time so much the better, he remarked.
The three boys hastened away in as
many different directions, each one making all
possible speed, for their hearts were evidently
in the work that now engaged their attention.</p>
<p>So well did luck stand by them, that before
three-quarters of an hour had passed by
the trio met again at the appointed place.
Each carried a small package, and, besides,
Bud had driven up in a rather dilapidated looking
old car that doubtless had a past history,
and now quite out of the running where speed
was considered a prime requisite.</p>
<p>Still, as Bud himself had remarked, it was
not polite to be too particular of a gift. The
car might carry them in safety over the forty
miles or more that lay between Oakvale and
the mobilization camp; then, again, they might
have a few punctures or blowouts, for the
tires were certainly in poor condition.</p>
<p>Hugh looked the machine over, and raised
his eyebrows expressively; whereat Bud hastened
to say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t condemn the old rattletrap yet
awhile, Hugh. Sometimes things turn out
mighty deceptive, you remember. She&rsquo;s seen
heaps of service in her day, for a fact, and
been pretty dependable, too, I wager. May be
she&rsquo;ll behave scrumptuously for us on this trip.
We&rsquo;re going on an errand of mercy, and deserve
encouragement, for a fact. Jump in,
fellows, and we&rsquo;ll get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they were soon off. The car groaned
and wheezed when power was applied, and
Blake looked pretty anxious until finally they
began to move along the road out of Oakvale
at a fair clip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, she seems to go pretty decent, after
all!&rdquo; declared the driver, for Bud, likewise
Hugh, knew much about the mechanism of
cars, and could pilot one as well as any boy
around Oakvale. Blake was a novice at such
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be making as much as ten miles
an hour right now!&rdquo; laughed Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which rate of speed, if continued, would
fetch us to the camp in less than five hours,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; demanded the now sanguine
Blake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, the worst is yet to come!&rdquo; grinned
Bud Morgan. &ldquo;You see, we&rsquo;re going on the
level now, and there happens to be some pretty
tough old hills which have to be surmounted
before we reach our haven. Hills can play
hob with most old worn-out cars. I&rsquo;m not
boasting any yet, Blake, you notice; hold your
horses, and we&rsquo;ll see what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some little time they continued to move
along fairly well, and a number of miles were
placed behind them. Indeed, they had even
managed to climb several good-sized elevations;
and, although once it seemed as though
the machinery was about to give up with a last
groan, clever Bud managed to pull the machine
to the top of the rise, so that they could
coast down the declivity, which they did in
great style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can run like a bird, once you cut the
power off, and let her coast,&rdquo; shrilled the enthusiastic
pilot, as they continued to &ldquo;scoot&rdquo;
along the level below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! but look what&rsquo;s ahead of us?&rdquo; cried
Blake, in an appalled tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that hill isn&rsquo;t half as bad as it seems,&rdquo;
Bud told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take it on the
run, and get to the top, all right, watch me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>He made an heroic effort to accomplish the
end he had in view, and, in fact, did manage
to negotiate more than three-fourths of the
climb. Then suddenly the engine gave up the
ghost, and only through a frantic use of the
brake did the pilot keep the car from starting
backward down the steep incline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are, held up!&rdquo; he remarked,
calmly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to me to get busy and see
what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you to it, Bud,&rdquo; Hugh told him,
stripping off his coat, and donning one of the
old linen dusters Bud had thoughtfully fetched
along for just this purpose, since he suspected
they would find good use for it.</p>
<p>They were a busy bunch for the next hour,
the two boys most of the time working under
the car and Blake hovering near, growing
more and more anxious as the precious minutes
slipped past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far have we come, do you reckon,
Hugh?&rdquo; he asked once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say about seventeen miles,&rdquo; the
other replied, after mental figuring; &ldquo;though
that&rsquo;s only a guess, because we don&rsquo;t happen
to have any way of telling. This car isn&rsquo;t
equipped with a cyclometer, you know, or any
other thing that costs money. I&rsquo;m surprised
that the tires have held out so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t much more than one-third of
the way to camp, either,&rdquo; declared Blake, disconsolately.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering what I could do
in case, after all your work, you fail to coax
the poor old engine into going again. It&rsquo;ll be
too bad if we get to the camp too late to carry
that letter back to Uncle Reuben in time; for
he is a terrible man to keep his word, and he&rsquo;ll
make that new will tomorrow night as sure as
anything, unless he hears from Felix by sundown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it comes to the worst,&rdquo; Hugh told
him, soothingly, &ldquo;you could wire Uncle Reuben
to hold up, and that a letter was on the
way with an ample apology. I suppose you
don&rsquo;t have any doubt about Felix giving you
such a letter, Blake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Hugh. Not that he cares so
much about the old gentleman&rsquo;s money, because,
you see, he has some of his own coming
to him in another year or so; but Felix is
a good-hearted fellow, and really cares a heap
for his guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Meanwhile, Bud Morgan was working with
all his might, trying to locate and cure the
engine trouble. Bud was a very determined
fellow, as his chums had learned many a time
in the past. Once he set his mind on accomplishing
anything he would persist everlastingly
at the job, even when it seemed next door
to hopeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to get on to it, boys, I want
to tell you,&rdquo; he finally said, as he crawled out
from under the car so as to stretch his cramped
limbs, and wipe the perspiration from his forehead
with a bandanna that had once upon a
time been a beautiful red, but was now sadly
faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But almost two hours have slipped by since
our plug engine balked on us,&rdquo; complained
Blake Merton, painfully. &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m trying
to rub it into you fellows, because both of
you are doing the work, while a greenhorn like
me has to sit around and grunt, and count the
minutes. If only some other motorist would
come along about now maybe he might be able
to lend us a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wish to gracious one would show up,&rdquo;
sighed Bud. &ldquo;What a fellow doesn&rsquo;t know
about pesky engines like this would fill a book.
Another pilot might just happen to be familiar
with this particular kind of trouble. &lsquo;Many
men, many minds,&rsquo; you remember. But don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;m going to give it up. There&rsquo;s a little
of the old U. S. Grant about me, and I purpose
&lsquo;fighting it out on this line if it takes all
summer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bully way of looking at it, Bud,
and I give you lots of credit,&rdquo; said Blake,
shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;If we stick here
until tomorrow I might just as well head back
toward Oakvale, for all the good a visit to
camp will do me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; warned Hugh, holding up a finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ginger! some one coming, as sure as anything!&rdquo;
ejaculated Bud, looking inexpressibly
relieved.</p>
<p>The plain sound of an approaching car could
now be heard. It was also coming from the
same direction as their course had just covered,
that is, from distant Oakvale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can see him starting to take the hill,&rdquo; announced
Blake, eagerly, &ldquo;and, say, if it is only
a flivver, it tackles the rise as if no ascent had
any terrors for it. One man is in the little car,
but, then, he may be an angel in disguise. I
hope so, I certainly do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the trio of anxious scouts waited for the
coming of the lone motorist whose small car
was already courageously mounting the elevation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">RISING SUSPICIONS</span></h2>
<p>The oncoming car soon reached the spot
where Hugh, Bud and Blake were stalled.
Hugh threw up his arm as a signal that they
would be greatly obliged to the party in the
lone machine if he would stop for a brief time
to hear their tale of woe, and either assist
them, or at least give advice.</p>
<p>The occupant of the little car was a dark-faced
man of middle age with what seemed to
be a perpetual smile on his face, or was it a
leer? Hugh did not like his looks any too well,
he confessed to himself. When motorists are
in trouble they have no business to find any
fault with the looks of a possible Moses who
might lead them out of the wilderness.
Whether he is handsome or homely, pleasant-looking
or a sour-visaged man matters little
if only he is accommodating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a mess, it happens, sir,&rdquo; Hugh
commenced saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; sneered the man, looking suggestively
at Bud&rsquo;s grimy hands, and then toward
the stalled ramshackle car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our knowledge of mechanics isn&rsquo;t all it
should be,&rdquo; continued Hugh, determined not to
be daunted by this poor beginning, &ldquo;and if you
could spare five minutes to take a look at the
cause of our trouble, perhaps you might tell
us how to remedy the same. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d
feel under heavy obligations, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly would,&rdquo; added Blake; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s of
prime importance that we get along just now,
because we&rsquo;re heading for the mobilization
camp, on an important errand, sir. Please
oblige us, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to throw all the pathos possible into
his application. Hugh thought the man was
laughing in his sleeve, so to say. At any rate,
he failed to make the first movement toward
getting out of his still throbbing car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>As a general thing, motorists are most accommodating
toward those in distress. It
seems to be a rule of the road that when the
signal is given, any one passing by must be
adjudged next door to a criminal. A fellow
feeling makes all men who drive motors sympathize
with one another, for there is no telling
just how soon they may themselves be in
dire need of the same help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to say I&rsquo;m in a desperate hurry myself,
boys,&rdquo; snapped the man, between his set
teeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to help you, but any delay just
now might cost me a big amount in money. I
reckon you&rsquo;ll get her going, some way or other.
At the worst, you could let her drop back down
the hill. I think there&rsquo;s a farmhouse up that
little dirt road half a mile or so where you
could stay over-night. So I&rsquo;ll have to push
along and leave you. Sorry, too, for I&rsquo;d like
to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he once more started along, and
the three scouts stared after him struggling
under various emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mean skunk!&rdquo; gritted Bud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix
my old engine if it takes a leg. Course, he
might have shown me a better way, but I&rsquo;m
coming along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake Merton was shaking his head as
though some new thought had taken possession
of his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;This means <i>something</i>, I tell you, Hugh!&rdquo;
he burst out with. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t just one of those
accidents that bob up now and then. That chap
was chuckling to himself all the while, just
because he had come on us stalled here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Hugh, somewhat startled
by such an assertion. &ldquo;Why should a
stranger care whether a pack of scouts were
held up with engine trouble or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and tell you, Hugh,&rdquo; came the quick
reply, as Blake&rsquo;s eyes snapped. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think
to mention it before because&mdash;well, so many
other things chased through my brain, you
know. But this is the same fellow I saw talking
to Luther Gregory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the degenerate son of Uncle
Reuben, the tough case he threw over, and
vowed never to have anything to do with
again?&rdquo; gasped Bud Morgan, stopping when
about to once more crawl under the stalled car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other,&rdquo; came the quick reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has he been seen again in Oakvale lately?&rdquo;
demanded Hugh. &ldquo;I remember that he got
mixed up in some row, and his father paid the
bill only on condition that Luke promised to
shake the dust of the home town off his feet,
and never show up again. If the slippery fellow
hadn&rsquo;t agreed to this, Mr. Gregory was
going to let the law take its course, for his patience
had reached the limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Blake, earnestly. &ldquo;I saw Luke
this very morning while getting my little package,
after leaving you fellows, and going home
to say good-bye to my folks. I, too, was surprised
to set eyes on him, knowing about that
promise to stay away from Oakvale. He was
talking with that very man we just saw pass us.
Hugh, they seemed to be on good terms, for I
saw them shake hands as if to bind some sort
of bargain. Then Luke discovered me, and
gave the other a nudge. I thought that man
stared mighty hard at me as I passed, just like
he meant to remember my face. Now, I&rsquo;m
wondering what all that could mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was silent for a brief spell. His mind
was endeavoring to grapple with the problem
that confronted him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems almost too big a thing to be true,
Blake,&rdquo; he finally remarked; &ldquo;but if Luke
Gregory could have in some way learned what
his father was meaning to do about making
another will, and cutting Felix out entirely,
why, he might think it worth his while to plot
so as to keep you from seeing your cousin in
Battery K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud Morgan whistled to indicate his deep
interest in the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I happen to know that Luke Gregory
used to be a right smart sort of a chap
when he lived in Oakvale,&rdquo; Bud observed. &ldquo;I
wager he&rsquo;s up to just that kind of a game.
However he could have learned the news we&rsquo;ll
never find out. He may have a spy among the
servants in the Gregory house, some one who
used to care for him when he lived at home,
and who reported the interview his father had
with Judge Marshall. Then, again, it might be
that same spy followed the lawyer, and saw
him talking with Blake here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty far-fetched,&rdquo; admitted Hugh.
&ldquo;You must remember that it was over the
&rsquo;phone the judge asked Blake to come and see
him. Possibly, though, this spy in watching
the lawyer&rsquo;s house noticed Blake going in, and
guessed why he had been sent for. But, no
matter, there seems to be a chance that Luke
<i>did</i> know, and that he believes it to be to his
interest to prevent a meeting between Blake
and Felix until the time set has expired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; mused Blake, &ldquo;that Luke has
never stopped hoping he might yet be able to
make up with his father, and that he thinks
his first move should be to get Felix out of the
running. This, then, would be too good a
chance to be lost. He has started that man
toward the camp, knowing about our coming.
So, now, we can understand why he seemed to
be grinning all the while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did seem to tickle him, seeing us stalled
here, and likely to stay for goodness knows
how long,&rdquo; admitted Bud, frowning.</p>
<p>Hugh took more stock in the theory the
longer he considered it. Although at first it
may have seemed far-fetched, just as he had
remarked, &ldquo;familiarity did not breed contempt&rdquo;
in this case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing to be done but, get
our engine running again, if we can,&rdquo; he said,
while Bud was hammering noisily under the
body of the car. &ldquo;If, in the end, that fails, we&rsquo;ll
try and think up some other scheme, for the
more difficulties that crop up in our path,
the more stubborn we become.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! thank you for saying that, Hugh!&rdquo;
exclaimed Blake. &ldquo;I know mighty well that
when you&rsquo;ve set your teeth, and start in to
win, something is bound to come from it. I
was beginning to get discouraged, but, say,
that&rsquo;s passing away now, and I seem to be
drawing in my second wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then there came a whoop from underneath
the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, fellows!&rdquo; called out a muffled
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ve found out how to fix
her up so she&rsquo;ll work again, Bud?&rdquo; cried Blake,
his face aglow with renewed hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch my smoke, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; was the reassuring
reply, followed by additional pounding;
and presently Bud wriggled out from his
confined quarters, a sight to behold, so far as
face and hands and discolored duster were
concerned; but Hugh paid little or no attention
to these things, because he saw that a huge
grin decorated the greasy countenance of his
chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Some more pottering followed. Then Bud
gave the crank a few turns. There was no
response, and evidently the balky engine still
declined to behave itself. Nothing daunted,
Bud tried a second, and then a third time.
When still once more he flirted with the crank
there came a sudden roar, and sure enough
the car rocked under the pulsations of the conquered
motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! you&rsquo;ve done it, Bud, sure you
have!&rdquo; cried the happy Blake, as he danced
up and down in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I get these things back again, and
wipe some of this mess from my face and
hands,&rdquo; said the mechanic, &ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll
start right up the hill with a push that can do
next door to anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really believe she&rsquo;s working better than
ever before,&rdquo; suggested Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, considering what I did in cleaning
things up,&rdquo; grinned Bud, holding out his grimy
hands, &ldquo;that isn&rsquo;t to be wondered at. She was
fairly clogged with dirt. Give me just another
minute, boys, and then we&rsquo;ll be on the
jump!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE HOLD-UP</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is something like living,&rdquo; Blake remarked,
after they had easily made the top
of the hill, and were coasting down the other
side with increased celerity, though Bud apparently
did not dare allow full speed for fear
lest something would happen to a dilapidated
part of the worn machinery, and cause a bad
accident.</p>
<p>All of them were pleased. Although much
time had been lost, still, with anything like decent
luck, they should easily be able to make the
camp while the sun still hung above the western
horizon. Blake asked for nothing better.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;That scamp in the flivver had nearly an
hour&rsquo;s start of us, boys,&rdquo; Blake later on observed.
&ldquo;By rights he ought to be ten miles
and more ahead of us, I say; but do you know
I half thought I caught a glimpse of his car
when we came over the top of the last rise,
and not so very far away, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly heard a sound that might have
been made by a car dashing across a short
bridge ahead, there,&rdquo; admitted Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which looks queer to me,&rdquo; continued
Blake. &ldquo;Do you think, Hugh, he might have
held back to see how we came out of that
scrape? Would he be figuring on doing something
to hold us up on the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the reply of the patrol
leader. &ldquo;All we can do is to keep a good
lookout as we go along, and fight shy of breakers.
If only Bud can keep that engine going,
we&rsquo;re bound to arrive, some time or other.
If that man tries to bother us, he may wish
he hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and the light that shone in Hugh&rsquo;s
eyes as he said this told how he meant every
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! he wouldn&rsquo;t be the first fellow who
felt sorry he&rsquo;d fooled with the scouts of Oakvale,&rdquo;
boasted Bud, with memories of previous
exploits crowding his brain. &ldquo;If a silly bear
will monkey with a buzz-saw, he c&rsquo;n expect to
get hurt, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pull up!&rdquo; hastily ejaculated Hugh as he
saw something glisten in the road ahead of
them.</p>
<p>They had just started around a bend, and
were going at a fair pace at the time. Bud put
on the brake, and the car speedily came to a
stand, but, alas! just a trifle too late to avoid
the breakers. There was a sudden explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! a tire&rsquo;s busted!&rdquo; cried Blake, in dire
dismay.</p>
<p>All of the boys jumped out, and it needed
only one look to tell them the truth, for the
left front tire lay flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glass!&rdquo; snapped Bud, wrathfully, as he
glanced around. &ldquo;Just think of anybody heaving
a bottle overboard like that, when there
are so many stones around. Seems to me the
least the rascal could have done would be to
throw the same into the bushes here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was bending over as though deeply
interested, and just then he electrified his two
companions by crying out:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was no accident, after all, fellows, but
a part of a cleverly arranged plot! These bottles
were fetched along purposely. They were
broken right on this rock, where you can see
all the fine glass; and the pieces were put on
the road so that a car couldn&rsquo;t pass along without
being terribly cut. See here, and here,
and here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud was furious. He gritted his teeth, and
growled like a &ldquo;bear with a sore head,&rdquo; as he
himself afterwards explained it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh! you&rsquo;re right, hang the luck if you
ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he went on to say, as he looked the
ground over. &ldquo;That miserable skunk laid the
plot, and I&rsquo;m sorry to say it worked like a
charm. See how he chose a place just around
a bend, so we mightn&rsquo;t get warning in time
by the sun glinting from the broken glass?
Oh! he&rsquo;s a corker of a schemer, that chap
is; and I&rsquo;d like to get my hands on him! Say,
what I wouldn&rsquo;t do to him would be hardly
worth mentioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget all that, Bud,&rdquo; cautioned wise
Hugh. &ldquo;That sort of talk never mends cut
tires. All of us must get busy, and see what
we can do. Luckily enough you made out to
have an extra tire along, even if it&rsquo;s a tough
proposition. Let&rsquo;s make the change in double-quick
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>All the while they worked the boys exchanged
opinions, and if that man could only
have heard what they thought of him surely
his ears would have burned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing certain,&rdquo; Hugh was saying later
on, as the job progressed fairly well, &ldquo;this
thing has settled the question about his being
interested in keeping us out of the mobilization
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it has, Hugh,&rdquo; admitted Blake,
jubilantly. &ldquo;When once you know what you&rsquo;re
up against, the chances of winning out are
stronger; anyway, that&rsquo;s always been my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you cleaned off the road ahead of
us, Blake?&rdquo; asked Bud, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;ll be on
the move again as soon as I get a little more
air in this tire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I walked along the road for a hundred
yards,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;and found no more
of the glass. I reckon he bunched it all around
here, so we couldn&rsquo;t dodge running smack into
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;After this,&rdquo; said Bud, grimly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slow up
whenever we come to a turn. You never can
tell what a wretch like that may have fixed
around the bend. Once bit, twice shy, isn&rsquo;t a
bad motto. I don&rsquo;t mean to get trapped in the
same way again, if I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was right, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Blake remarked,
with a touch of satisfaction in his voice,
&ldquo;when I said I felt sure I had seen that flivver
a mile or two ahead of us, when it should have
been at least ten miles further along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct, Blake,&rdquo; assented Hugh;
&ldquo;your eyes told you the truth. All of us will
have to keep on the watch right along. The
man who could play such a mean trick on people
in a car with such bad tires as this one has
would be equal to anything, in my opinion.
Ready now, Bud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that tire seems to be pretty snug,&rdquo;
came from the hard-worked pilot, who, however,
never once complained, for Bud was not
a shirker, if he did have certain faults of his
own to contend with. &ldquo;I only hope the others
don&rsquo;t turn out to have been cut so they&rsquo;ll go
back on us sooner or later. Glass like this is
a bad proposition when you&rsquo;re running on
worn rubber.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Once more they were moving along. How
keenly they kept their eyes on the lookout for
further trouble ahead could be detected by the
manner in which all three forgot to observe
the scenery around them, the dusty road monopolizing
their attention.</p>
<p>As the minutes continued to slip past they
had the satisfaction of knowing that they were
putting the miles behind them. Five and
more had been dropped since that last accident.
Blake asked further questions concerning
the probable distance over which they had
now come, and as usual Hugh was able to give
a conservative guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of twenty-five miles from Oakvale by
now, I should say,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;If you
want to know how I&rsquo;m able to say that, let me
explain. I have a rough map of the country
up here. I copied it hastily from one they
had at the recruiting tent, for you know the
battery must have come along this same road
we&rsquo;re now on. A mile back we saw a crossroads.
That was marked on the map with the
figures twenty-four; so after all it was easy
to add another mile to that score; and there
you are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only for your long head in making a rough
copy of that road map, Hugh,&rdquo; declared the
admiring Blake, &ldquo;we would certainly be up
against it now. Well, that leaves some fifteen
or twenty more miles. Can we fetch it by sundown,
do you believe, Bud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! easy going!&rdquo; came the flippant reply,
though accompanied by a side wink in the direction
of Hugh, which was possibly intended
to convey the meaning that the aforesaid result
could be attained if they were fortunate,
and met with no further mishaps such as had
already delayed them on two occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re coming to some sort of village,&rdquo;
observed Hugh, later on, &ldquo;for I can see
a small house on one side of the road, with
some chickens and a dog in the way. Slow up,
Bud; we don&rsquo;t want to race through here, and
be hauled up for exceeding the speed limit;
or else have to stop and pay for some silly
hens that were bound to get under our wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several cottages were passed. Then they
came to a stretch of woodland, beyond which,
doubtless, the town proper lay, for they could
see signs of smoke rising, and there was also
a sound as of an engine working in some sort
of mill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Suspecting no immediate trouble, the boys
were running along quite smoothly when,
without the slightest warning, they received a
sudden shock. Again it came to them just
around a bend in the road, though Bud had
kept his word, and was moving slowly at the
time.</p>
<p>A rope was stretched directly across from
one tree to another. To make the hold-up even
more positive, a log had been rolled out, and
lay there, blocking the road, so that even should
a swiftly-going car have broken the rope, it
was bound to come to grief against that other
obstacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull up, Bud! quick!&rdquo; almost shrieked
Blake Merton, but he might just as well have
spared himself the trouble of letting out this
frantic appeal, for the driver had his car well
under control, and was easily able to bring it
to a halt some ten feet away from the obstructions.</p>
<p>No sooner had they halted than a gruff voice
was heard calling out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw up your hands and surrender, you
three young raskels! I&rsquo;ve got yuh covered, all
right, and yuh might as well give in peaceable
like, because you&rsquo;re up against the strong arm
of the law!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">AN ECHO FROM THE PAST</span></h2>
<p>The boys, following up this rasping voice,
stared to see the figure that broke out of the
scrub close to the barrier, and approached
them. No wonder they almost felt their
breath taken away, for had this been a scene
from some ridiculous motion picture play, the
representative of the majesty of the law as
met with in a country marshal or constable,
could not have seemed more ridiculous.</p>
<p>The man was old, and spare of figure. He
was dressed in gray garments, and wore a
large soft hat built after the Western sombrero
model. It had a gilt cord around the crown,
and was tilted up rakishly on one side. Even
to the glistening nickel star, that decorated his
left breast, was this representative of law and
order, gotten up to shame one of those stage
sheriffs at whose antics youngsters in the
cheap &ldquo;movies&rdquo; scream with laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, fellows, on your lives!&rdquo; whispered
Hugh, instantly, afraid lest rash Bud,
for instance, should break out into a loud roar
that would seriously offend the officer, and
mean further trouble for them.</p>
<p>He raised his hands, as did the other two
boys, though Blake was complaining after his
customary fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, say, we couldn&rsquo;t have broken any
speed law, Mister, because you saw yourself
we were just fairly <i>crawling</i> along?&rdquo; he protested,
weakly.</p>
<p>The officer was holding a tremendous horse
pistol of an ancient vintage; it had an ominous
look, and doubtless could give a fair account
of itself if fired, for they made good
weapons in old-time days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said as how yuh was pinched for
speedin&rsquo;, did I?&rdquo; he went on to observe, with
a grim smile hovering about his stern mouth,
while his beady eyes continued to rove from
one boyish face to another. &ldquo;Huh! I guess
now it&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; a heap worse nor <i>that</i> you&rsquo;re
wanted for. Where did yuh git this car?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it belongs back in Oakvale,&rdquo; stammered
Bud, hardly knowing what it meant
when the man with the nickel star shot this
question directly at him as the pilot of the
expedition, or at least the one who was handling
the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;K&rsquo;rect. That corresponds with the information
I had given tuh me,&rdquo; continued their
strange captor, nodding his head until his
goatee made him resemble a pugnacious billy-goat.</p>
<p>Hugh instantly began to see a faint glimpse
of light. Something about the words which
the constable had just uttered gave him a suspicion
as to the possible truth. He began to
take a deeper interest in the hold-up, which
could turn out to be of an altogether different
character from what they had up to that moment
believed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he started to say, giving the
constable one of his frank smiles, &ldquo;after all,
don&rsquo;t you think you may have made a mistake
in holding us up as you have? Honest,
now, do we look like fellows who would steal
a car; and even if we ever had such a scheme
afoot, wouldn&rsquo;t we be apt to pick out a machine
worth taking, rather than a rattle-trap like this
ramshackle thing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The constable somehow seemed a bit impressed.
There might have been that in the
manly bearing of the boy who was speaking,
as well as something in his voice that touched
a responsive chord in his old heart. He stroked
his straggly chin whiskers with his unemployed
hand, and continued to ogle the three
lads so eagerly leaning toward him from the
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh! waal, it does seem like yuh&rsquo;d be a passel
o&rsquo; fools tuh grab a rattle-trap car as this
un when yuh might a had your pick. But then
he says tuh me there was a reason why yuh
did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then some one put you wise to our
coming along this road, did they?&rdquo; Bud flashed
out. &ldquo;Guess we can hit on the skunk, all right,
Mister. He was a little ornery reptile, wasn&rsquo;t
he, with a grin on his black face all the time?
Tell me, doesn&rsquo;t that cover his description all
right, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Eben Wheezer, and I am the
reg&rsquo;lar authorized constable of Halletsburg,&rdquo;
the other went on to explain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m free to
confess that I was give a pointer concernin&rsquo;
yuh boys. Mebbe it&rsquo;s jest a lark you&rsquo;re playin&rsquo;,
but, all the same, when a car has been taken
without the owner&rsquo;s knowledge or permission,
the eye of the law looks on it as a <i>bony fide</i>
theft. It becomes the duty of a constable to
pinch the offenders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Mr. Wheezer, please,&rdquo; urged Hugh.
&ldquo;Delay of even an hour would mean a serious
thing to us just now. We are on our way to
the mobilization camp, and it is of extreme
importance that we get there some time this
evening. That man you talked with seems to
be an enemy of ours. He is connected with
a scamp back in Oakvale who would be glad if
we failed to get to the camp, because it might
mean money in his pocket. He has already
done his best to knock us out, even filling the
roadway with glass from broken bottles, so as
to cut our weak tires, and keep us from getting
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which happened, too, as you can see if you
glimpse that tire we&rsquo;re carrying, and which
is slashed something terrible,&rdquo; interjected Bud,
impulsively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The country constable was interested, seeing
which Hugh returned to the attack on the
principle that when you have the enemy started
a vigorous offensive should be carried out to
get him on the run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, Mr. Wheezer,&rdquo; Hugh went on to
say, confidingly, &ldquo;we are, as you see, scouts.
Our uniforms will tell you that, our badges
too; and, if you want, I can show you a number
of clippings from the papers that tell of certain
things of merit the Oakvale scouts have
done in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gum! what&rsquo;s that shiny medal you&rsquo;re
wearin&rsquo;, son, stand fur?&rdquo; suddenly demanded
the constable, fixing his glittering eyes on
Hugh&rsquo;s left breast. &ldquo;She looks a heap like the
real stuff to me, an&rsquo; gold, at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh at once took it off and passed it over.
If ever he felt proud on account of the possession
of such a fine medal, that time was then
and there, because he believed it was going to
save himself and chums a good deal of trouble
and time.</p>
<p>The constable put on a pair of glasses with
huge horn rims, and peered at the inscription,
turning the neat little medal over in his hands.
When he looked again at the owner there was
a marked interest in his thin and pinched face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, air yuh this same Hugh Hardin
it speaks of here?&rdquo; he demanded, hoarsely, taking
a step nearer the halted car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That happens to be my name, sir,&rdquo; replied
Hugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did yuh git this here medal fur savin&rsquo;
lives when that flood was rampagin&rsquo; through
the town of Lawrence?&rdquo; continued the officer,
his voice now showing signs of hoarseness
that might have come from excess emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Several of my chums and I
were visiting there when that dam up the valley
broke, and the bridge over the river was
carried away. We had a pretty lively time of
it during the few days we were detained there,
on account of no trains running. We managed
to hold out a helping hand to some of the
poor people caught in the flood. You know,
sir, that&rsquo;s what scouts live for, to assist others
not so well off as themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eben Wheezer heard the boy through. Then
he did a number of queer things, first of all
ramming that ancient pistol out of sight in
one of his pockets, and then actually holding
out a thin and trembling hand to Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, son, I want tuh shake hands with yuh,
that&rsquo;s what I do!&rdquo; he startled them by saying,
enthusiastically. &ldquo;This hold-up is all off,
yuh understand. I was an old fool tuh take
that rascal&rsquo;s seegar, and b&rsquo;lieve half he says
tuh me &rsquo;bout some boys comin&rsquo; along the road
here as how he reckoned had stole a car, and
that there was likely tuh be a reward offered
fur their apprehension, which I might jest as
well rake in as the next un. But I kin see it
all now, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m right glad tuh meet up with
Hugh Hardin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about me, Mr. Wheezer?&rdquo;
asked the patrol leader, flushing at the
same time with pleasure as he felt the cordial
grip of that lean hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! only this, son,&rdquo; laughed the old constable,
pumping the boy&rsquo;s hand as though he
might be the milkman making up a deficiency
in his cans, &ldquo;it happens that I had an ole wife
a visitin&rsquo; over there in Lawrence at the time
that dam broke. Yes, and, what&rsquo;s more, she
told me it was a boy named Hugh Hardin
that kim along with some other scouts in a
rowboat and saved her from a house that was
a-floatin&rsquo; off in the flood. Huh! think I&rsquo;d ever
forgit <i>that</i> name when it belonged to the lad
who kept me from bein&rsquo; a forlorn widower?
This here is a joyous occasion for me, I tell
yuh.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Bud gave a whoop, and danced around like
a crazy thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk to me about bread cast upon the waters
returning before many days,&rdquo; he was crying
excitedly. &ldquo;Did anybody ever hear the
equal of this! See, Hugh, how your good deeds
repay you heaps of times over. We thought
we had run across another enemy, and he turns
out to be a bully sort of a friend. Won&rsquo;t you
shake hands with me, Mr. Wheezer, even if I
wasn&rsquo;t lucky enough to be in that bunch that
did such good work at Lawrence&mdash;the honor
of that exploit goes to Hugh, here, Billy
Worth and Monkey Stallings. But, then, we&rsquo;re
all chums, you know, sir, and in the same
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The delighted constable was only too glad
to oblige Bud, and so warm was his grip that
possibly the other felt a tinge of regret at insisting
upon being given a hand-shake. Blake
Merton felt that it would not do for him to
be left out in the cold, so he had to grimace and
bear it when Eben got to working his lean fingers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Indeed, all of the boys felt they had good
reason for feeling thankful. What had threatened
to prove a disaster and promised to overwhelm
their plans was now working in their
favor. The wearing of his badge, given by
Scout Headquarters to those members of the
organization who have saved human life at
great peril to themselves, had turned out to be
a most wonderful blessing to them. Instead
of being held up, perhaps thrust into a miserable
country lock-up until the next day, with
their plans ruined, they were now free to proceed
along their way.</p>
<p>Hugh did not want to lose any more time
than could be avoided, so instead of entering
into a long conversation with the constable, he
hastened to say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we were not in such a great hurry, Mr.
Wheezer, it would give me great pleasure to
stop over with you, and visit your home, to
meet your wife. I reckon I would know her
again if I saw her. I&rsquo;d be glad to tell you the
story of what happened over in Lawrence
when the flood swept down the valley. But we
have a big stake in trying to make that camp
by tonight. One of my chums here has a
cousin in the battery who stands to lose a fortune
if we are kept back; and the man who
hired that rascal you met hopes to win it. So
you&rsquo;ll excuse us if we say good-bye now, and
thank you for being so kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable had already removed the log
from the road, and now he unfastened his
stout rope from the tree to which he had attached
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apologies needed, son,&rdquo; he hastened to
say, cheerily. &ldquo;Yuh knows your business best,
and if yuh chase after it in the same way yuh
won your spurs over tuh Lawrence, I reckons
now yuh&rsquo;ll upset all the kalculations o&rsquo; thet
schemer. Good-bye an&rsquo; good luck tuh yuh,
boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved his official hand to them as they
shot forward, and the last Blake saw of the
odd, though good-hearted country constable,
he was standing there in the road looking after
the retreating car, and still waving his sombrero,
while that bright nickel star on his
manly breast gleamed in the rays of the westering
sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, Hugh!&rdquo; cried Blake, bubbling
over with delight over their recent narrow
escape. &ldquo;They say chickens come home to
roost, and that good deeds will pay a fellow
back a thousand fold. Well, I want to tell
you there never was such a positive illustration
of their truth as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best of it is,&rdquo; laughed Hugh, happily,
&ldquo;that no matter how much our enemy plots
against us, something comes along to upset all
his calculations. He thought we were stuck
there all afternoon, with an engine out of joint,
but Bud here fooled him. Then there was
that broken bottle game, which did hold us up
a bit; but in spite of a slit tire we got started
again. Last, but far from least, he fixed up
this clever trick of telling the old constable
three boys had stolen a car, and were coming
along the road a ways back; also hinting that
there might be a good reward offered for capturing
the rascals and holding them over-night
in the town cooler. But again our luck held
good, and we slipped through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied now,&rdquo; asserted Blake Merton,
&ldquo;that nothing is going to keep us from
getting there some time tonight. I&rsquo;ll hunt up
Felix right away, talk to him like a Dutch
uncle, get him to write that letter, and then
the first thing in the morning we can start
back home again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;If anything goes wrong with the car, we&rsquo;ll
find some other way of returning, make up
your mind to that, Blake,&rdquo; Hugh assured him.</p>
<p>It was in this happy frame of mind that
the three scouts passed through the little town
of Hallettsburg, and continued onward. As
they went they could frequently discover plain
signs that to their practiced eyes assured them
the battery had traversed the same road they
were now on. Perhaps a boy untrained in
the art of using his eyes, and seeing small
things that told a story, would never have been
able to accomplish this thing; but Hugh, Bud
and Blake had served their time at studying
woodcraft, as practiced by the Indians from
the days of Daniel Boone, and they knew
dozens of things that would, when noticed
and examined, tell an interesting story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The sun was getting pretty low in the west,
and evening was coming on. It was about the
last quarter of the moon, which had been full
on the fifteenth of the month, so that no help
from this source could be expected until
toward midnight, when the silvery remnant
would be seen rising in the East. That was
one reason why the boys were anxious to be
getting on as fast as they dared chance it, because,
once night settled in, their progress
would be blocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s going down, Hugh,&rdquo; announced
Blake, with a touch of dismay in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very true,&rdquo; replied the scout master,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll have half an hour of light yet,
perhaps more, and I think we ought to make
the camp in that time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">THE BURNING BRIDGE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; called out Blake Merton a short
time later, &ldquo;did you see that light flash up
ahead of us there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I did,&rdquo; came the immediate
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it could be one of the camp
fires of the boys, a sort of vidette post, you
might say?&rdquo; further questioned Blake, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it goes again, as sure as you live!&rdquo;
ejaculated Bud Morgan at the wheel, &ldquo;and,
say, it&rsquo;s a fire, all right&mdash;growing stronger
all the while. I wonder what it can mean
for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon find out,&rdquo; remarked Hugh, confidently.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re advancing, and will come to
a clear stretch in a minute or so, where the
trees happen to be sparse, and we can see
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, after all, it&rsquo;s only some cabin
alongside the road, with the people doing their
cooking outdoors,&rdquo; observed Bud. &ldquo;I saw that
done heaps of times when my folks took me
down to Florida that winter I was sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their curiosity grew by leaps and bounds
as they proceeded along the road. The closer
they drew to the scene of the illumination, the
more puzzled all of the boys found themselves.</p>
<p>Then suddenly it broke upon them. They
must have turned a bend in the road, for just
as though a wave of a magician&rsquo;s wand had
caused the picture to appear before their eyes,
they saw it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! look at that, will you?&rdquo; shrilled Blake,
aghast at the vision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bridge afire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is!&rdquo; echoed Bud, staring as though
he could hardly believe his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how the flames are creeping along the
wooden sides!&rdquo; continued the Merton boy, hysterically.
&ldquo;Why, they look like red snakes,
that&rsquo;s what they do. Hugh, what can we do
to get across that river if the bridge goes
down?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you just yet, Blake!&rdquo; snapped
the other. &ldquo;Let her out some more, Bud.
Never mind the risk to the old plug of an engine;
we&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to get there so as to fight that
fire, or we&rsquo;ll be dished. I know what stream
that is, and it&rsquo;s a deep one, too, far too deep
for us to ever hope to ford it with this car.
Faster, Bud, faster, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud Morgan never accepted anything that
bordered on a dare. He had held in thus far
principally because he knew Hugh would not
be apt to countenance speed when it necessitated
additional risk. Now he &ldquo;let out another
notch,&rdquo; as he himself would have expressed it.</p>
<p>The old car shambled along with dizzying
celerity, making all manner of ridiculous
sounds, as though protesting against such
haste. Still nothing happened to indicate another
breakdown; and at least they were advancing
toward the burning bridge with accelerated
speed.</p>
<p>All the while Hugh was wondering what
could have caused the fire. It was very
strange, he concluded, that a country bridge
should take a notion to start up in a blaze like
this, and just when it became a most important
link in their drive to the concentration camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>So they arrived on the scene. Bud was evidently
for trying to run the gantlet with a mad
rush, but Hugh called upon him to draw up
short, which he did, stopping the car close to
the near end of the wooden structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have made it, Hugh!&rdquo; urged
Bud, reproachfully, as though he regretted the
cautious policy of the scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there would always be a chance that
our gas tank would explode!&rdquo; cried Hugh;
&ldquo;look how the flames are driven straight across
the bridge by the wind. Then the fire is along
both sides, so we&rsquo;d have to run a regular gantlet.
No, Bud, old fellow, we couldn&rsquo;t afford
to take the chances. Out with you all, and
let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t save the old bridge yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, boys!&rdquo; shouted Bud, instantly on
the move, for he was a lad of action, and never
happier than when doing things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work on the windward side first!&rdquo; ordered
Hugh, with the sagacity that leadership
in an energetic scout organization is apt to
bestow upon any wideawake youth. &ldquo;Here,
snatch up these old lap-robes, and souse them
in the water. If you beat at the flames just
as we did when the woods on fire that time,
you&rsquo;ll find they can be mastered. Everybody
get busy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop! watch my smoke, will you!&rdquo; cried
Bud, starting off with a rush.</p>
<p>There chanced to be some old lap-robes in
the car that Bud had managed to secure, not of
any great value, to be sure, so far as things
of beauty went, but bound to be of great value
in an emergency like the present. Each of the
three scouts managed to secure possession of
one of these, and it required but a brief time
to submerge the same in the swift flowing and
deep stream.</p>
<p>With this soaking cloth in hand the energetic
boys started to fight the fire, slapping
at the running flames as they curled along the
side of the bridge in long spirals that resembled
creeping snakes.</p>
<p>When three lively fellows get started at a
task of this sort it is wonderful what remarkable
progress they can attain. With each stout
blow it seemed as though the fire that was
threatening to demolish the entire wooden
structure received a serious setback. The boys
fought their way completely across the bridge,
which was not of any great length.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough for us!&rdquo; cried the panting
Bud. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve licked that line of skirmishers;
do we tackle the other side now, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One good turn deserves another, so go for
it!&rdquo; advised the leader, setting a pace himself
that kept the others hustling to continue in
the same class.</p>
<p>Success is always encouraging, and, having
found that they could get the better of those
creeping flames, the three boys fought all the
harder, determined to crush the fire completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little more elbow grease, boys, and victory
is going to perch on our banner!&rdquo; Bud was
crying, while he slapped that scorched laprobe
again and again on the railing of the
bridge, even mopping up the floor with it when
occasion demanded.</p>
<p>The boys were past masters at this sort of
thing. They had served their time at it on
another occasion, when the woods, catching
fire not many miles from Oakvale, they had
been called upon to help save certain isolated
farmhouses and crops that were threatened
with destruction.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Breathing heavily, the three lads finally had
the satisfaction of seeing the last zigzag line
of fire succumb to the vigor of their attack.
Still, Hugh would not be wholly satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down and wet these rags again,&rdquo;
he told his chums, &ldquo;and hunt out every crack
where the least bit of fire hides, so that after
we go on it isn&rsquo;t going to spring up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well make a clean job of it while
we&rsquo;re about it,&rdquo; agreed Bud, as he followed
Hugh down to the edge of the river, there to
immerse their &ldquo;fighting togs&rdquo; again in the
water.</p>
<p>As they walked along, carefully scanning
both sides of the bridge for any evidences of
hidden peril, Bud once more broke out, voicing
some suspicion that he had evidently been harboring
in his brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s mighty funny
how this old bridge could get afire? Suppose
a threshing machine traction engine could have
passed over here lately; but, then, it&rsquo;s too early
in the season for anything like that to be going
around. If a man on a wagon threw a
burning match aside after lighting his pipe,
would it start things to burning? Somehow
I just can&rsquo;t believe this is an accident at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! do you really mean you suspect it
was done <i>on purpose</i>, perhaps to keep us from
crossing this deep river, and making us miss
connections with the camp?&rdquo; asked Blake, apparently
thrilled with the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain of it,&rdquo; asserted Hugh, positively.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Just bend your heads
closer here, and take a whiff where this rail
has been only a little charred; what does it
smell like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Hugh, it makes me think of home,
when the girl is starting our oil stove going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; added Bud, gritting his
teeth ferociously, &ldquo;and somebody&rsquo;s gone and
saturated both sides of this bridge with kerosene,
so as to give the fire a good send-off.
Oh! the low-down wretch, what wouldn&rsquo;t I
give to have a chance to choke him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it again over here, and you get the
same odor,&rdquo; Hugh observed, impressively;
&ldquo;yes, and right there you can see where some
of the stuff spilled, for the spot looks greasy.
He must have had a can of kerosene along
with him in his car for just such a purpose as
this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Each boy in turn dropped on his hands and
knees, the better to take a &ldquo;sniff&rdquo; at the discolored
spot on the floor boards of the bridge
that had such a &ldquo;close call.&rdquo; As they once
more regained their feet they nodded their
heads, unanimous in their opinion as to the
origin of that greasy mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which shows that our good luck still
haunts our footsteps,&rdquo; Blake said, trying to
smile happily, though there was a deep-seated
look of apprehension to be detected in his eyes.</p>
<p>Truth to tell, all of them were more or less
impressed with the malignity shown by this
party whom they believed to be in the pay of
Luther Gregory. He was evidently bent upon
earning the sum promised him in case he, by
hook or crook, prevented the boys from reaching
the mobilization camp until it was too late
to secure that apology from the quick-tempered
Felix.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do we cross over now, and move
along our way?&rdquo; asked Blake, unable to conceal
the anxiety he naturally felt because of
these numerous delays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to hinder that I can see,&rdquo; replied
Hugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive the old car across, presently,
while you two wait for me at the other side,&rdquo;
Bud said, as he climbed aboard. &ldquo;Take a good
look as you go, and tell me if any of the flooring
is burned through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they crossed over, Hugh and Blake kept
a good lookout, and reported all safe; so presently
Bud, having coaxed the engine to start
again after some effort, joined his mates on
the further side of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do hope,&rdquo; ventured Blake Merton,
with a sigh, as he proceeded to settle down
in his old seat again, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ve run up against
the last obstacle. It&rsquo;s certain that chap can&rsquo;t
think up much more evil to turn against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s coming now?&rdquo; cried Bud. &ldquo;I can
hear shouts, and, Hugh, there seems to be men
running around that clump of undergrowth
alongside the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you there&rsquo;s a village along there, and
that the people have just discovered the smoke
of the fire here,&rdquo; advanced Blake. &ldquo;They know
about the bridge, and are coming to save it.
They would have been just too late if not
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to give us a vote of thanks,
then, for our services,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to &rsquo;em shouting, will you?&rdquo; continued
Blake. &ldquo;Why, it sounds to me like they
were real mad at something. Hugh, don&rsquo;t it
strike you that way, too? Look at some of
the fellows in the lead shaking their fists at
us, just as if we&rsquo;d gone and done something
mean. Gee whiz! I hope now they don&rsquo;t get
the notion into their silly heads that <i>we</i> started
this bridge to burning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite a crowd was coming wildly toward
them, consisting of men and boys, though there
were also a few energetic women. Some of
them carried clubs, and waved these in a suggestive
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit tight,&rdquo; warned Hugh, sternly; &ldquo;it
means that we&rsquo;re up against it again. Above
all things, don&rsquo;t do or say anything to start a
fight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">THE ACCUSATION</span></h2>
<p>If one of the three scouts entertained doubts
as to the hostility of the mob that came running
along the country road, these were quickly
dispelled. In another minute the car was surrounded
by an angry crowd. A dozen voices
shrilled at them, and sticks were shaken in
their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back, everybody!&rdquo; shouted a burly
man, who seemed to be invested with more
or less authority. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the sheriff of this
county, it happens, and I don&rsquo;t allow any interference
with my business. Three of my
posse being present, I call on them to stand by
me. The rest of you hold your peace. I&rsquo;ll
do what talking is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh was glad to know this. He could deal
with, a single individual, where it was utterly
impossible in the case of an excitable mob. So
Hugh hastened to speak up, addressing his remarks
to the man of authority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly tell us what all the row is
about?&rdquo; he asked, pleasantly. &ldquo;We are heading
for the camp where the State militia is
mobilizing, and, discovering this bridge afire,
worked with all our might to put out the flames.
If you look at those dirty cloths lying there,
you&rsquo;ll find that they were once lap-robes. We
soaked them in the water, and slapped the
flames out as we were trained to do in fighting
a forest fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few of the villagers may have been impressed
with the words spoken by Hugh, as
well as his manly bearing; but they were vastly
in the minority. Most of those present were
so worked up by anger that they seemed blind
to the facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe him, Sheriff,&rdquo; urged one man,
venomously; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only lying. All boys&rsquo;ll lie
whenever they get a chanct. I know these
here scouts, how they like to strut around like
heroes. And, Sheriff, you c&rsquo;n depend on it
they set fire to our bridge just a purpose to
make believe they did a big thing whipping
the flames out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he told us they&rsquo;d like enough
say,&rdquo; called out another man, whose small face
and vinegary looks told of a mind that was below
the mediocre. &ldquo;He says he saw &rsquo;em running
around like they was pourin&rsquo; something
on the sides of the bridge from a bottle. Say,
I kin smell coal oil, by Jimminy crickets; if I
can&rsquo;t now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock the young rascals up, Sheriff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larn &rsquo;em a lesson they&rsquo;ll never forget.
&rsquo;Cordin&rsquo; to my mind, there&rsquo;s a heap too much
talk nowadays &rsquo;bout boys doin&rsquo; great stunts.
It&rsquo;s jest upsot a lot o&rsquo; &rsquo;em, so they&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo;
around all the time for ways to make people
think they&rsquo;re jest like little David when he
knocked over that Goliath chap long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So several other men had their say. Hugh
listened to it all, and waited for an opportunity
to get a chance to explain. He knew that
he must depend on the sheriff, and so he kept
him in mind when he finally started in to speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;Please listen to me, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo; he began
to say, impressively. &ldquo;We belong in the town
of Oakvale, where you&rsquo;ll find, if you telephone
the Chief of Police, that our reputation is gilt-edged.
We are on our way to the big camp
over beyond the hills yonder, where Battery K,
from Oakvale, is located. We have very important
business with one of the members, who
is a cousin of this boy here. It will cost him
his inheritance if we are unable to talk with
him by tomorrow. There is a man whose interest
it is to keep us from doing this. He has
tried through an agent of his in a number of
ways to hold us back; and, if you wish, I would
take pleasure in telling you all about these
things. Sir, we have good reason to believe
that this setting fire to your bridge was a part
of his scheme to detain us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, boy?&rdquo; asked the sheriff, hastily.
&ldquo;Can you tell us what this man you&rsquo;re
speaking of looks like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man passed us while we were fixing our
engine on the road hours ago,&rdquo; Hugh readily
explained, &ldquo;and when we asked him to lend
us a hand he said he was in too big a hurry
to stop. He seemed to be grinning all the
while, as though tickled at finding us in such
a bad mess. We believe that man is the agent
sent out to hold us back from arriving at the
camp until it is too late to do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he a little man, with a sharp face,
and eyes that glittered like a snake&rsquo;s?&rdquo; called
out one of the more friendly disposed men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he was in a flivver, a small machine
with the top down,&rdquo; explained Bud, taking
part in the affair now. &ldquo;He wore a suit
that looked as near green as you could find,
and had on a leather cap with goggles pushed
up above the peak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff was impressed by what he heard.
At the same time, he did not appear disposed
to drop the case against the three lads. Perhaps
the knowledge that some of those in the
crowd refused to take any stock in the story
of the boys influenced him more or less; for
murmurs were heard rising here and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe half he says, Sheriff,&rdquo;
one man called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys c&rsquo;n be all-fired tricky,&rdquo; another remarked,
sharply, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s certainly got a
smooth tongue. Better run the lot of &rsquo;em in,
and make &rsquo;em prove their innocence. That&rsquo;s
the best way to fix it, &rsquo;cordin&rsquo; to my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh felt uneasy. If the sheriff were so
disposed he could, of course, lock them up on
suspicion; and while nothing might eventually
be done toward convicting them for the
crime of setting fire to the bridge, the delay
would cost them dear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>But it happened that once more in their extremity
fortune worked what almost seemed
like a miracle in their behalf. Hugh noticed
that two children had joined the crowd. He
also knew that they had certainly not come
along the road with the runners, for they could
never have kept pace with the mob racing
toward the river.</p>
<p>A sudden thought struck him. He turned
to the sheriff and began to suggest a plan of
action that would possibly prove the truth or
falsity of the charges against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo; Hugh began. &ldquo;I
think that small boy and girl there must have
been somewhere near by, because they came up
out of the bushes here just now. Ask them
questions, won&rsquo;t you, sir, and find out if they
saw anything of what took place here? It may
be they were in hiding, and saw us come up
while the bridge was burning. It&rsquo;s only a fair
deal we want, sir, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree to
that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The sheriff was more impressed than ever
with the bearing of the boy who addressed him.
Besides, the plea he advanced seemed very
plausible. He turned upon the two children, a
bright-looking boy and girl of about ten. They
were barefooted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Billy Burt, and you, too, Sally,
were you hiding in the bushes here when we
came up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s what we was,&rdquo; said the boy,
urged to speak by sundry punches in his side,
given by the elbow of his girl companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you hide there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We was skeered when we got here, and
seen the fire,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the bridge was burning, was it, when
you came along?&rdquo; continued the sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shore was,&rdquo; the boy told him, positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were these boys around at that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy stared at Hugh and Blake and Bud,
then he grinned. &ldquo;Nixey, they wasn&rsquo;t. They
kim hurryin&rsquo; along, and fit the fire like wildcats.
Yuh jest orter seen how they slashed
and slashed around till every bit o&rsquo; flames was
done fur. Me&rsquo;n Sally jest hid there in the
bushes an&rsquo; watched the fun. It was better&rsquo;n
the movin&rsquo; picture fire I seen down in Hallettsburg.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! that ought to settle the case against
us, I should think,&rdquo; laughed Bud as the boy
finished his recital, which, though framed in
ungrammatical language, loomed as high as
any speech ever delivered before a judge in
an appeal to free the accused before the bar.</p>
<p>The sheriff threw up his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, briskly, &ldquo;you win. Instead
of plucking you, and running you in for attempted
arson, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to thank you most
heartily on behalf of the village of Scroggs
Corners, which I happened to be visiting this
afternoon on business. Only for your efficient
work we&rsquo;d have been a bridge shy tonight.
Shake hands with me, and kindly excuse my
excess zeal that might have worked you all an
injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, the boys bore no malice. They were
only too happy to know that nothing was going
to interfere with their onward progress.
In fact, they felt as though victors in the brisk
engagement between this clever foe and themselves.
It was likely to be the last expiring
effort of the unscrupulous schemer; after this
he would have to give up the attempt to keep
them from the camp until sufficient time had
elapsed to destroy all hopes of Felix making
his peace with his uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you could only manage to round up that
smart rascal who did set this fire, Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo;
Bud could not help saying, when shaking hands
with the official, now very friendly toward
their cause, &ldquo;it might be possible to prove the
crime against him. Perhaps you may discover
he had been carrying kerosene in his car, and
that would be a strong piece of evidence
against him. He&rsquo;s given us heaps of trouble,
which is partly why I&rsquo;m showing such a rattlesnake
spirit toward him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to send word along the line, and
round him up if he can be headed,&rdquo; the sheriff
admitted, though Hugh really believed he had
not dreamed of such an idea until Bud made
his suggestion.</p>
<p>Of course, even those who had been most
disposed to believe the boys guilty of arson had
now been convinced of their innocence by the
statement of the boy who had seen all that
went on from his hiding-place. So when Bud
started the car once more there was no sign
of opposition; indeed, only cries of goodwill
followed the scouts as they proceeded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Passing through the village, which they
found to be laboring under more or less excitement,
the trio continued on their course.
Later on, when they came to a steep hill, the
engine balked again, so that half an hour was
lost in coaxing it to be good.</p>
<p>Blake had been sighing with impatience
through the operation. Once he had even gone
so far as to suggest that he and Hugh start
on foot, since it could only be a matter of a
few miles at the most that lay between them
and their intended destination. The working
mechanic, however, nipped this scheme in the
bud by declaring that he was getting the upper
hand of the balky engine, and hoped to be able
to make a fresh start before ten minutes more
had passed.</p>
<p>Still, that half-hour delay was fated to have
some effect upon their fortunes.</p>
<p>When the engine trouble had been mastered,
and they were again on the way, Blake seemed
content. The persistent manner in which his
comrades managed to meet each new crisis as
it appeared, and win out through any and
every kind of trouble, elicited his ardent admiration.
Blake was ready to declare that the
day&rsquo;s reckoning would only redound to the
credit of scout efficiency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Hugh suspected that they were now close
upon the big camp. He must have caught certain
sounds to tell him this. At least, as they
drew near the top of the slope, he bade both
his chums keep on the lookout, because he believed
they were due for a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>Loud exclamations broke from their lips
when, on reaching the summit, they beheld a
wonderful spectacle spread before them.
Night was gathering, and already the broad
valley beyond the ridge lay in semi-darkness,
for the moon would not rise until very late.</p>
<p>Scores, almost hundreds of fires, were burning
a mile or more away, looking weird to the
startled eyes of the three scouts. They could
also discover a myriad of the same kind of
khaki waterproof tents that Battery K had
used in Oakvale when endeavoring to drum up
recruits at the station in the public square.</p>
<p>There lay the great mobilization camp of
the State before them, with some thousands
of stalwart young men training so as to be
accepted by the Government for service along
the far distant Mexico, where the threatening
shadow of war hovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">IN THE MOBILIZATION CAMP</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this sure pleases me!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bud, as he stopped the car on the summit of
the ridge, so that they could feast their eyes
on the remarkable spectacle of all camp fires
burning in the near distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; breathed Blake, &ldquo;and
well worth all the trouble it&rsquo;s cost us to get
here. I reckon that we must be close to the
border of the camp, and can expect to be held
up by a sentry any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to start up my headlights going
down this decline,&rdquo; admitted the pilot. &ldquo;The
more we drop into the valley the darker it&rsquo;ll be;
and we can&rsquo;t afford to meet with a smash-up
at this stage of the game, when we&rsquo;ve about
won out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took especial pains in going down the
slope, and finally the bottom was reached in
safety. Here they were suddenly greeted with
a gruff command to halt, and discovered a soldier
in khaki bearing a gun standing alongside the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this does look like war-times, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; said Blake, in a low tone, &ldquo;when you get
hauled up by a vidette post. Hugh, please fix
it so we can go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some conversation followed between Hugh
and the guard. Then a non-commissioned officer
was called, and more talk ensued. Hugh
had laid out his plan in advance, and so sagaciously
that in the end he was given permission
to move on, although a soldier was placed
upon the footboard of the car to accompany
the scouts to the quarters of Battery K.</p>
<p>Possibly the fact that they too wore the
khaki had something to do with their being allowed
to enter the camp at this late hour, so
long after the time when soldiers were given
a chance to see relatives and friends. No matter
what the reason, all of the boys felt as
though they had won fresh laurels in making
that run from the home town in such a rack of
a car, and also being obliged to overcome baneful
opposition of an unscrupulous enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>They followed the road and were soon
amidst some of the glowing fires. Here they
found guardsmen sitting around, and eating
their supper, which had evidently been prepared
by the company cooks according to the
rules that govern the summer training camps.</p>
<p>So far as Hugh and his chums could see,
they were a jolly crowd, laughing and carrying
on as though they did not have a care in
the wide world. Once the bitterness of parting
from their loved ones had been passed
over, these healthy-minded young soldiers
could play their part like men, and meet every
situation that was likely to arise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m nearly tickled to death because
I came,&rdquo; Bud was saying as they rolled
along the road between two rows of fires that
crackled and sent up myriads of sparks. &ldquo;Talk
about camping out, this has got all our experiences
knocked to flinders. Why, there
must be millions of soldiers here in this big
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better say thousands, and be nearer the
truth, Bud,&rdquo; cautioned Blake. &ldquo;But it is a
great sight, and one we&rsquo;ll never forget, either.
If a fellow needed to have his patriotism
stirred to the bone, he&rsquo;d get it done here. See
how Old Glory is fastened up over that big
tent yonder. Now I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if
that was the colonel&rsquo;s tent; or it might even be
Headquarters for the general in charge of all
these forces of the State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to pass through the whole camp
before we come to where Battery K is located,
so the sergeant said,&rdquo; Hugh remarked, as they
moved slowly on.</p>
<p>Numbers of the soldiers came forward to
have a look at those in the car. Possibly some
of them may have entertained vague hopes
that the newcomers might turn out to be
friends or relatives, urged to make the trip by
a desire to glimpse a dear face once more before
the guardsmen were ordered South.
Hugh believed there was a wistful expression
on many of the faces he saw turned their way.</p>
<p>As for Blake, he could hardly restrain his
impatience. The fact that inside of a comparatively
few minutes more he was to see his
cousin, and that there was still plenty of time
for accomplishing his mission before another
day dawned, filled him with ecstacy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we must be nearly there,
Hugh?&rdquo; he would say, pleadingly. &ldquo;There
couldn&rsquo;t be any mistake now, could there, so
that we&rsquo;re going the wrong way to strike our
boys of Battery K? Are you sure it&rsquo;s directly
along this road, Bud, we ought to keep on going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the <i>non-com.</i> told us,&rdquo; replied
the driver of the car, &ldquo;and we must abide by
orders when we&rsquo;re in a military camp. Besides,
we&rsquo;ve got some one along with us to
show us the way; so ease up, Blake, or you&rsquo;ll
crack sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right, Bud,&rdquo; admitted the
other, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll try to hold myself in; but somehow
I can&rsquo;t feel dead sure till I&rsquo;m shaking
hands with Felix, and know it&rsquo;s going to be all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact of the matter was, as Hugh suspected,
Blake was now beginning to fear that
his impulsive cousin might prove obdurate,
after all, and absolutely decline to humble himself
so as to write a letter of apology to his
uncle and guardian. Of course this would settle
the matter just as positively as though that
agent of Luther Gregory had succeeded in
holding them up by having them arrested and
kept for twenty-four hours in some village
jail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look yonder, will you?&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed
Bud, nodding his head, and using one
hand to point to the left with, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a battery
of field-pieces, but it isn&rsquo;t the one from
Oakland. Just beyond must be the camp of
the Engineers, because you can see a heap of
picks and shovels and such tools lying there.
You know the Engineer Corps have to make
roads, build cook-houses, lay tent-floors for the
officers&rsquo; quarters, and do heaps of things like
that. A fellow told me about it who used to
belong, and quit because he said it was such
hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look over on this side, Bud, and you&rsquo;ll see
something that tickles you,&rdquo; called out Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Signal Corps&rsquo; headquarters, I&rsquo;ll be
bound!&rdquo; ejaculated the other in sudden admiration.
&ldquo;See the wires they&rsquo;ve run out. I
warrant you every command in the whole camp
has a telephone in its headquarters, with a
Central station to boot. Now, if only I could
run across the aviation field, and see a few
hangers for aeroplanes in evidence, I&rsquo;d be
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;re further away, over to the
right,&rdquo; explained the soldier who stood on the
footboard of the car. &ldquo;We have three &rsquo;planes
working every day now, and more coming
along. My brother is one of the air pilots, you
know, so what I&rsquo;m giving you is straight goods,
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were by this time gradually approaching
the other end of the great camp, as could
be told from the fact that the fires were becoming
less numerous beyond them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your battery lies just ahead of us now,&rdquo;
announced the soldier, who seemed to be thoroughly
acquainted with the lay of the camp,
and able to direct any one to the location of
each and every unit composing the entire
mobilization centre.</p>
<p>Yes, they could already begin to see guns
posted in a clump, or &ldquo;parked,&rdquo; to use a military
term. These seemed to have a familiar
look to the Oakvale scouts, because they had
many times handled the dull-finished modern
field-pieces, doubtless envious of the luck of
those whom they chanced to know as members
of the company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Leaving the car alongside the road, the boys
followed after their guide, who led them directly
over to where the battery had its tents,
Immediately Hugh and his two chums began
to recognize familiar faces. A number of the
men jumped to their feet and hurried toward
the newcomers. Hugh noticed that in some
cases it was a look of sudden concern that came
upon the reddened faces of the young artillerymen;
and he could give a pretty good guess
why this should be so. They were assailed
with sudden fears lest something terrible
might have happened to those left behind in
the home town, and that the scouts had been
dispatched to carry the sad news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Hugh. Hello, boys. What fetches
you away off here?&rdquo; called out one of the Battery
K members; and his question must have
voiced what was on the minds of several
others, since they all waited anxiously to hear
what Hugh might say in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to have a little chat with Blake
Merton&rsquo;s cousin, Felix Gregory, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; the
patrol leader answered, at which something
like a look of relief passed over several faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it must be something pretty important
to fetch the three of you forty and
more miles in a car?&rdquo; suggested one fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it is,&rdquo; jauntily admitted Blake.
&ldquo;Now, can any of you direct us to where we&rsquo;ll
find my cousin Felix?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking with him about half an hour
back, but haven&rsquo;t seen him since, now you mention
it!&rdquo; one called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise you boys to look up Captain Barclay,
and he&rsquo;ll put you in touch with Felix,
who must be around somewhere, because we
have orders not to wander beyond bounds.
There&rsquo;s the captain&rsquo;s tent over yonder, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was big Hank Partridge, a
cousin of Lige Corbley, and quite well known
to Hugh. As the advice seemed sound, the
scout master immediately turned his face
toward the tent thus pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, boys, and we&rsquo;ll see what the
captain can do for us,&rdquo; he told his two mates,
at the same time starting forward.</p>
<p>Blake was by now beginning to have that
worried expression steal back upon his face.
His old fears had awakened again, as was evidenced
by the remark he made almost immediately
after they started toward the captain&rsquo;s
tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty queer, I think, how not a single
one of all those fellows could remember
seeing my cousin inside of half an hour.
Things have been happening so contrary lately
I&rsquo;m beginning to be afraid that something may
have come along to whisk Felix out of the old
camp here so I never will find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how silly to let yourself borrow trouble
in that way, Blake,&rdquo; Bud told him, scornfully.
&ldquo;What could carry him off but an aeroplane,
and I&rsquo;m pretty sure they haven&rsquo;t yet got to
ducking down in the heart of a camp, and
snatching a fellow up bodily. Just hold your
horses, and we&rsquo;ll run on him pretty soon now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the tent of the commanding
officer, where a sentry always stood on guard.
Hugh, knowing the rules that applied, asked
to see Captain Barclay, with whom he was,
of course, well acquainted. In another minute
the captain himself came forth.</p>
<p>He shook hands with Hugh and the other
two scouts. Then the story was briefly told,
particular emphasis being laid on the numerous
attempts that had been made to keep them
from meeting Felix Gregory. The officer was,
of course, deeply interested. To lose such a
fortune as Uncle Reuben owned would, he felt
sure, be a calamity for any young fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;You deserve every encouragement, boys,
after what you&rsquo;ve done to save Felix from the
folly of his quick temper,&rdquo; he told them at the
close of the recital. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he must have
been sorry long before. I know his generous
nature well. I&rsquo;ll send out and have him come
here to you. Then Blake can talk with him
aside, and, if my influence is worth anything,
you can depend on it I&rsquo;ll only too gladly say a
good word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he gave an order, and the soldier to whom
it was delivered hastened away. While he was
gone the boys continued their chat with the
captain. Finally the messenger returned, made
his salute to his superior officer, and said something.
Hugh was watching and saw the other
look grave. Blake clutched the arm of his
chum when the captain of Battery K, advancing
slowly toward them, went on to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange to say, boys, so far no one can be
found who has seen Private Gregory inside of
half an hour. He seems to have mysteriously
disappeared; but, of course, he can be found,
and if you will wait for me here I&rsquo;ll go the
rounds myself and rout him out. Don&rsquo;t worry
while I&rsquo;m gone, for it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FELIX</span></h2>
<p>When the captain turned and left them
again, the three scouts exchanged uneasy
glances. Blake suffered more than either of
his chums, for his heart had been wrapped
up in his task. It meant much to him whether
he failed or won out in his self-imposed mission
to the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, do you know I expected something
like this would happen,&rdquo; was the way he expressed
himself. &ldquo;Somehow, even when we
had beaten that scheming rascal at his game
several times, I seemed to have a feeling that
in the end he might be too smart for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently, then,&rdquo; remarked Bud Morgan,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve already made up your mind that
this queer disappearance of your cousin Felix
can be laid at the door of the same man
we had so much trouble with on the road, the
chap in the flivver?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it stand to reason it must be that
way?&rdquo; demanded Blake. &ldquo;Why should Felix
clear out of camp here otherwise? These fellows
of Battery K are in for the war, and
wouldn&rsquo;t desert for all the money going. Felix
is as loyal as they make &rsquo;em; he&rsquo;d sooner
cut his hand off than be thought a coward or
a quitter. So there&rsquo;s only one way of explaining
his vanishing; which is through this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Hugh?&rdquo; and Bud turned
toward the patrol leader, as had become a
chronic habit with most of the members of the
troop whenever anything arose to bother or
mystify them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I can say as yet,&rdquo; replied the other,
steadily, &ldquo;is that it begins to look a whole lot
that way. We had better wait a bit before
deciding. The captain may pick up some information
that will give us a pointer. Men
don&rsquo;t disappear from a mobilization camp, as
easy as all this, without leaving some traces
behind them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake shook his head dismally. Apparently
he was losing heart, for so many things had
arisen to balk his ambition that the strain was
telling on him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is I wish this business
was all over,&rdquo; he observed, plaintively, &ldquo;and
we were on our way back home with that
precious letter to Uncle Reuben. I tell you I&rsquo;ll
feel like shouting if we do win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Victory is always sweeter when you&rsquo;ve had
to fight hard to get it,&rdquo; Bud declared, with boyish
philosophy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we all remember that
when we&rsquo;ve been up against a tough proposition,
and had to take the bit between our teeth
before we could land? Never lose faith in
what you&rsquo;re doing, Blake. For one thing,
you&rsquo;ve got a couple of comrades along that
mean to stand back of you through thick and
thin. That ought to be some comfort to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Bud, it certainly gives me a heap of
satisfaction, the way both of you stick to me.
I&rsquo;m going to take a brace up! We&rsquo;ll get there
yet, we&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to, and that&rsquo;s all there is
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brave words, those, and possibly Blake
Merton meant them, but, nevertheless, there
were times when that anxious look would
creep over his face again, as fresh difficulties
kept piling up before them, and the desired end
seemed as far away as ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>They continued to stand there and talk for
some little time, all the while eagerly awaiting
the return of the friendly captain, whom
all of them knew very well, since he was a
prominent business man in Oakvale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he comes!&rdquo; asserted Bud, suddenly.</p>
<p>Blake lost color, and his hand trembled
when he accidentally touched the sleeve of
Hugh&rsquo;s khaki coat&mdash;perhaps, after all, it was
through some design that this contact came
about, for a positive realization that the scout
master was standing by him must have given
Blake renewed confidence, of which he was
evidently in great need just then.</p>
<p>Captain Lawrence Barclay came hastily
toward them. Hugh, discovering the look of
annoyance still on his face, guessed that he
bore bad news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Blake, and show that you can
stand whatever may be coming,&rdquo; he managed
to say in a low tone to his companion.</p>
<p>Then the commander of Battery K arrived.
He was a bluff sort of a man, not much given
to beating around the bush when he had anything
to say; nor could he smooth over disagreeable
news as some men might.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to report that young Gregory
seems to have disappeared from camp altogether,&rdquo;
he immediately remarked. &ldquo;It is a
most extraordinary occurrence. In fact, several
officers with whom I&rsquo;ve spoken say they
would never have believed a man could vanish
from the midst of a thousand or two of his
fellows, with sentries posted, and camp rules
in force. But I&rsquo;ve sent out in every direction
to find Gregory, but without any success so
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Blake and Bud left things pretty much
to Hugh, knowing his ability to handle such
a case. Like a wise scout, the patrol leader
immediately began to ask questions, with the
design of getting facts that might give them
a clue to the solution of the camp mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; he started in to say, &ldquo;would you
mind telling us when Felix Gregory was last
seen about here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Several men seemed to agree on that point,&rdquo;
replied the accommodating officer, &ldquo;and I am
inclined to say that it was just about half an
hour back. At the time he was talking with
a civilian who had managed in some way to
gain permission to enter the camp in his car.
From what I have learned, I believe Felix appeared
to be considerably excited while he held
this conversation with the stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugh, just as we suspected, it must have
been that man!&rdquo; gasped Blake. Bud Morgan
nodded his head, and pinched the other to keep
him quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any of them describe the man and his
car, Captain?&rdquo; continued Hugh. &ldquo;You remember
what we told you about the party who
gave us so much trouble on the road? He was
a small fellow, with a dark face, and snappy
eyes, and his car was one of that cheap class
called a flivver. Does that agree with what
any of the men said, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to cover the case exactly, Hugh,&rdquo;
the officer hastened to admit; &ldquo;and, taken in
conjunction with your remarkable story, makes
the matter seem more mysterious than ever.
Apparently, then, that man who tried to prevent
you from getting to camp, finding that all
his schemes had failed, turned another tack,
and now aims to keep Felix from seeing you.
How he has been able to get him out of the
camp beats me; it would seem to be an impossible
task.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Hugh was on his mettle now; his fighting
blood aroused. The gleam in his eyes told that,
as he shut his teeth together with a snap, and
went on to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be some way of tracking them,
and we&rsquo;ll find it out by hook or by crook, Captain
Barclay. If that man succeeds in keeping
Felix hidden away for the next twenty-four
hours our goose is cooked, because then it&rsquo;s
going to be too late for any reconciliation between
him and his guardian. But there will
be hours before that happens, and every minute
of that time the three of us here will be
working like beavers to find out the truth. We
never give up until the last gasp; that&rsquo;s a slogan
of the scouts, you know, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mighty fine rule for any one to go by, I
must say,&rdquo; remarked the officer, looking admiringly
at the speaker&rsquo;s flushed and determined
face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard lots of good things
said about you Oakvale scouts, and now I can
understand why you&rsquo;ve always met with such
splendid success. I want to say, Hugh, that
you can count on me to render any assistance
in my power. What can I do for you now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Hugh was equal to the occasion. Although
he had had little time in which to map out his
course, owing to the sudden surprise by which
they had been confronted, he knew that one
thing would be needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could manage it, Captain Barclay, so
that we three might go about camp without
being held up, and put to a whole lot of inconvenience,
it would help us a heap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can be arranged, I think, Hugh,&rdquo; said
the other, after a brief period of reflection.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and get the general to write out three
passes, such as they may be, and word them
so that you&rsquo;ll be likely to have no trouble moving
about. It is something unusual, of course,
to allow civilians to remain in camp at a time
like this, especially over night; but I think I
can manage it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the three lads again, the captain
entered his tent to start operations looking to
securing the passes. There was more or less
sending of messages, possibly between Battery
K and Headquarters, while Hugh and his companions
tried to possess their souls in patience.</p>
<p>Finally, after a long delay, Captain Barclay
again made his appearance, and in his hand
he bore several folded papers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had more trouble than I expected,
boys,&rdquo; he told them pleasantly; &ldquo;but I believe
everything is smoothed over now, and you will
find little trouble in moving about. Only a few
newspaper correspondents have so far been
given the same privileges; but when the general
learned what fine things you scouts had
to your credit in and around Oakvale, he
obliged me with his signature. Which shows
again how a good reputation pays every one a
high rate of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each of the boys received one of the
&ldquo;passes&rdquo; that would allow them to wander at
will through the mobilization camp for the
next twenty-four hours, the privilege expiring
with the setting of the following day&rsquo;s sun;
for after that time Hugh and his comrades
would have no longer any desire to remain
there, since their mission before then must be
either a success or a failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell us what others thought of
the disappearance of Felix Gregory, Captain?&rdquo;
Hugh remarked, as though anxious to learn
this fact, since it might have a bearing on the
solution of the mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I interviewed one man in particular
who was rather chummy with Felix,&rdquo; replied
the officer. &ldquo;His name is Andrew Burtis,
and you all know him well. He told me
he felt sure there was something on the mind
of Felix, for he brooded over something, and
acted strangely for a fellow of his happy disposition.
In fact, it was Andrew who suggested
that possibly the young chap had gone
out of his mind over some trouble, and while
in this condition had managed to leave the
camp, for some purpose or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we know what it was troubling Felix,
sir, as we have told you,&rdquo; burst out Blake Merton,
eagerly. &ldquo;I guess he was worrying about
that quarrel with his uncle, because they had
thought a good deal of each other. But it
would never cause Felix to go out of his mind,
Captain, you can believe me. No, that man was
responsible for his going away; and Hugh
here will get on the track, some way or other,
I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have my best wishes, boys,&rdquo; said
the officer. &ldquo;I must leave you now, as I have
duties to look after; but if I can do anything
to assist you later on, be sure and look me up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>He shook hands most cordially with each one
of them in turn, and there could be no question
about his sincerity when he made that assertion.
Left to themselves, the scouts faced
a situation calculated to try their mettle to
the utmost. Poor Blake in particular looked
woe-begone as he turned a beseeching eye on
Hugh, fully conscious that the last lingering
hope of finding his missing cousin rested with
the scout leader&rsquo;s dogged pertinacity. Belonging
to the <i>Wolf</i> Patrol meant a good deal to
Hugh Hardin; for in a case of this kind he
knew that it would be necessary to emulate
the example of the wolf that follows the track
of a deer over hill and through valley, hour
after hour, day and night, until by sheer persistence
he has run the tired quarry to earth,
and so secures the meal he sought.</p>
<p>So Hugh would never give up so long as a
shred of hope remained. He was determined
to start out and seek for a clue capable of
leading him to success. Yet, after all, it happened
that accident had considerable to do with
the final outcome of the big game upon which
the three scouts had embarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">BUD MORGAN ON THE SCENT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s our plan of campaign, Hugh?&rdquo;
asked Bud Morgan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to say,&rdquo; remarked the
scout master, &ldquo;that if we separated, and covered
as broad a field as possible, the chances
for picking up some sort of clue would be all
the better. In that way we could agree to
meet here, say in an hour or so, and compare
notes. Then if by good luck one of us managed
to strike a warm scent we could lay out
a scheme for taking up the trail. What do you
say to that, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of the others admitted that what Hugh
proposed would be the wisest move. Doubtless,
Blake would have been happier had Hugh
decided to keep him in his company; but, then,
he was too proud to hint at such a thing. Besides,
he realized that the greater field they
covered, just as Hugh had said, the better
would be their chances for picking up news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>So they separated, with the understanding
that in about an hour from that time they were
to come together again near the tent of Captain
Barclay, so as to compare notes and decide
on the next step.</p>
<p>Bud Morgan was more than eager to wander
about the big, bustling camp. There were
a thousand interesting things he wanted to see
for himself. This was a golden opportunity
which he meant to utilize to the utmost. He
had been yearning for just such a legacy of
good luck; and it had really come to him. That
magical paper, signed by the general himself,
would allow him to move at will. If any sentinel
challenged his right to be amidst the tents
of the assembled guardsmen representing the
sovereign power of the State, all he had to do
was to flash that document before his eyes, and
the sight of the name signed at the end of
the pass would end the detention instantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>So Bud started forth with high hopes. He
really meant to do all that lay in his power
to assist poor Blake find his missing relative;
but, then, while thus engaged there was no reason
that Bud could see why he should not have
a look-in at those things in which his heart
were was bound up.</p>
<p>For a short while, then, he talked with some
of the Battery K boys whom he knew, and who
were naturally delighted to see any face from
the home town.</p>
<p>Bud managed to show nice discretion. He
was averse to telling the story of Felix, and
his silly quarrel with his rich uncle and guardian
to every one; and so, when by a few judicious
questions, he found that those with
whom he chatted had no information to give
him, he soon broke away and resumed his wanderings.</p>
<p>In this fashion he soon exhausted the limited
fund of information that could be picked up
among the artillerymen of Battery K. The
result was so meagre that Bud felt disgusted.
He must branch out and seek other fields. Far
and wide he would continue his investigations,
ask his leading questions, and seek by every
possible means in his power to get a clue worth
having.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>By degrees, however, his ambition began to
wane. He met with so little success that he
began to allow himself to grow slack in his
efforts. Hugh would be almost certain to unearth
some clue, for he most always did accomplish
whatever he set out to perform. Then
Bud was wild to spend a little time with the
Aviation Corps, for deep down in his boyish
heart he cherished an ambition to some day
be an air pilot.</p>
<p>This would account for his fetching up in
the distant section of the camp where he had
been told the aviation squad had their hangars.
More than half an hour had passed since parting
from his chums, and Bud could truly say
that he had worked faithfully to unearth a few
crumbs of comfort for Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deserve a little recreation,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;All work and no play makes Jack a
dull boy. I may never get another such a fine
chance to talk with fellows of the aviation
class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus relieved his mind of any remorse
he might have felt, Bud hurried his
steps, and before long found himself in the region
of the odd-looking hangars, or sheds, hastily
constructed, in which several aeroplanes
rested when not in use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>He had met with little obstruction thus far.
Several times a sentinel had stopped him, acting
under orders, but the sight of the magic
paper had always sufficed to cause the man
with the bayonet and gun to wave him along;
so that by this time Bud was under the impression
he could go anywhere he pleased.</p>
<p>Arriving at the ground where the birdmen
held forth, he found a number of bronzed
young fellows squatting around a fire, and
swapping stories of possible past experiences.
As Bud came up and stood there, curious
glances were cast upon him. Perhaps most of
them jumped to the conclusion that he must
be the representative of some important newspaper,
for Bud was a pretty husky sort of a
fellow for his age; and young blood is often
sought after by the great metropolitan dailies.</p>
<p>So Bud presently dropped down, and sat
there listening. He drank in all he heard
those aviators saying. One of them, it seemed,
had been across the sea, and taken part in
some of the dangerous forays, when Allied
aeroplanes made daring raids on fortified
towns or military concentration camps in the
rear of the enemy forces, and his reminiscences
of the thrilling scenes upon which he
had gazed held Bud spellbound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Others in the little group had not been so
fortunate in seeing actual hostilities, but each
man in turn narrated certain adventures that
had befallen him; for even in piping times of
peace aviators meet with perils calculated to
make a stirring story.</p>
<p>One man in particular interested Bud. At
the time he hardly knew why this should be so,
for they were all strangers to him. Afterwards
he was inclined to believe there must
have been some sort of intuition about it, causing
him to listen to everything this air pilot
was saying.</p>
<p>His name seemed to be Johnson, for Bud
heard him called that several times. The conversation
had turned upon odd incidents connected
with meeting people under peculiar conditions,
and as he listened Bud heard Johnson
saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Queer how people bob up that you&rsquo;d never
expect to meet. Now, today while we were
on the road here from the station, with the
truck carrying our &rsquo;plane, I had a thing like
that happen to me. Two years back it came
about that I was flying at county fairs down
in Florida. I did it as a means for making
ready money, because I wanted to get hold of
a new model hydroaeroplane that I was wild to
own. My companion in the Fair venture was
a fellow I never really liked, though he certainly
had plenty of grit, and knew a heap
about this flying business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we separated in the end, because I
couldn&rsquo;t stand for some of his crooked ways.
From that day to this I did not see him once;
yet today, when we passed a little old house
on the road here from the railway station, who
should I see looking from the second-story
window, and staring at all the aviation squad
moving along, but my former partner of the
Florida county fair flights. Which shows how
small this old world is, after all. Why, I
wouldn&rsquo;t have been any more surprised if I&rsquo;d
landed on top of Mount Washington, and come
face to face there with Luther Gregory!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Bud almost fell over, he received such a
shock at hearing the aviator calmly mention
that name. Luther Gregory, the wild son of
Uncle Reuben, the very man whose scheming
had caused the scouts all that trouble while
on the road to the mobilization camp&mdash;it came
to Bud almost like an inspiration that in this
astonishing way he had struck a clue.</p>
<p>Through his brain chased a dozen brilliant
thoughts. Why, if Luther Gregory had really
been the employer whose money had hired that
clever trickster in the flivver to do everything
in his power to obstruct the progress of Blake
and his chums, didn&rsquo;t it stand to reason that
the chief plotter must have come on the ground
in order to have a hand in the final attempt to
keep Felix from making up with his uncle?</p>
<p>Bud wanted to shake hands with himself, he
felt so tickled. For some little time he sat there
and communed with himself, laying out various
plans whereby he and Hugh and Blake
might yet win the game that had seemed to be
going against them.</p>
<p>He was suddenly aroused by seeing Johnson
getting on his feet, and yawning, as if he felt
sleepy, and thought of turning in, although
&ldquo;taps&rdquo; had not yet sounded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Bud came to a quick determination. He
must have a little chat with the air pilot, and
learn a few facts from him. In order to accomplish
his end it would be necessary for him
to relate the story of Felix, but he could bind
the other to secrecy. So he also arose and followed
the aviator.</p>
<p>When a tap came on his shoulder, and Johnson
turned to find himself confronted by the
boy, he may have noticed sitting near the fire,
listening, no doubt he felt a little curiosity as
to why he had been picked out for an interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ve selected the wrong man,
young fellow,&rdquo; he went on to say with a jolly
laugh, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re expecting a thrilling yarn for
your paper. Better tackle Tom Sherlock,
who&rsquo;s seen exciting adventures over the big
drink. He can spin you a story that will make
your readers&rsquo; hair stand on end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to have a little chat with you,
Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; urged Bud. &ldquo;I would thank
you to give me just a few minutes of your
time. It is on a matter that means a whole
lot to a chum of mine. The queer part of it
is that the mention of Luke Gregory&rsquo;s name
by you is the whole cause of my asking this
favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aviator, naturally enough, was surprised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve managed to arouse my curiosity
from the start, my boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
heartily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be only too glad to listen to anything
you may have to say. Come over here
to my tent and sit down on a bench there; we
can talk better at our ease. Right from the
beginning let me say that if Luther Gregory
has any share in your story, I&rsquo;d wager it isn&rsquo;t
going to be to his credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hit the nail right on the head when
you say that, Mr. Johnson!&rdquo; declared Bud,
mentally hugging himself with delight over the
wonderful success that had come his way.</p>
<p>He started in by telling how he and Hugh
had been trying to find some reasonable excuse
for visiting the mobilization camp, when Blake
came along and told about the unfortunate
quarrel between Felix and his uncle. Then
Bud went on to relate how they had started
for the camp in the old car. Step by step he
narrated the difficulties they had to surmount,
and how they felt positive most of their troubles
came through the plotting of the man in
the flivver, and who had been seen talking in
a mysterious fashion with Luther Gregory in
Oakvale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>It was an altogether thrilling story, and the
aviator listened with rapt attention until Bud
had come down to the point where he heard
him mention that name of Uncle Reuben&rsquo;s
profligate son, and tell how he had actually
seen him close to the border of the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I want you to tell me, Mr. Lawrence,&rdquo;
Bud wound up with, &ldquo;is the location of that
little old house where Luther Gregory, you say,
was looking out of the second story window
as your Aviation Corps passed this afternoon.
Don&rsquo;t you see, if they have managed somehow
to sneak Felix out of camp, it stands to reason
he would be taken to that place, and kept
hidden for twenty-four hours or so, until the
time limit was past. Oh! please tell me, so I
can carry the news to my chums, who will be
tickled half to death to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air pilot saw the point, and proceeded
forthwith to enter into such explanations that
Bud felt sure he could not miss finding the
place; and after that he hastened to break
away, being fairly wild to see Hugh, and tell
him the great news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">THE VALUE OF A GOOD REPUTATION</span></h2>
<p>When Bud presently arrived at the appointed
rendezvous neither of his comrades
were in sight. He was nervously walking up
and down when a few minutes later Blake put
in an appearance.</p>
<p>Blake looked particularly woe-begone. Evidently
all his efforts to pick up a promising
clue to the solution of the great mystery had
failed miserably. Seeing Bud&rsquo;s nervous stride,
he eyed him hungrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something ails you, Bud, I&rsquo;m sure it does
from the way you act!&rdquo; he exclaimed, fresh
hope struggling to gain a new grip on his heart.
&ldquo;Please tell me if you&rsquo;ve found out anything at
all, because I haven&rsquo;t had the least bit of luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve nosed around like a regular
bloodhound on the scent,&rdquo; observed Bud, with
perhaps a little pardonable pride, &ldquo;and I reckon
now I&rsquo;ve got some <i>important</i> news for Hugh
when he shows up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! have you found Felix?&rdquo; burst from
Blake, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er, hardly as strong as that,&rdquo; admitted
the other, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve run across a man who
saw Luther Gregory looking from the second-story
window of a house not two miles from
the border of this camp, and only this afternoon,
in the bargain; which you&rsquo;ll have to own
up is some evidence that he knows what&rsquo;s happened
to your cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake proceeded forthwith to pump the
hand of his wideawake chum as though in this
fashion alone could he show his sincere appreciation
of the wonderful news Bud had
brought in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes Hugh right now,&rdquo; added Bud,
with the smile of conscious superiority spread
across his face, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;ll be something doing
soon, believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The scout master approached. He did not
look particularly happy himself, for, to tell the
truth, Hugh had failed to succeed in finding
any conclusive evidence that promised to take
them to where the absent Felix might be
found. When he saw how his two comrades
were beckoning to hasten his steps, and discovered
their triumphant manner, Hugh lost
no time in joining them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see that you&rsquo;ve had more success
this time than fell to my lot,&rdquo; was his salutation
as he came up; &ldquo;now string it off, and tell
me what&rsquo;s happened to make you both look so
oh-be-joyful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud waited for no second invitation. It did
not happen every day that he was given such
a splendid chance to shine in the limelight, and
he would not have been a genuine boy had he
failed to take advantage of the golden opportunity.
So, in as terse terms as he could possibly
summon to the front, he told the story
of how, after a myriad of efforts, he had finally
run across what seemed to be a most promising
clue.</p>
<p>Hugh listened and made little comment until
the story had been ended. Then he gripped
the other&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bud, old man, I&rsquo;m beginning to think that
the luck of this deal is running strongly in your
direction!&rdquo; he exclaimed, heartily. &ldquo;If that
master schemer of a Luther Gregory is close
by, the man he hired must know where to find
him; and it stands to reason that if he succeeded
in bundling Felix out of camp, even if
no one is able to tell how it could be done, why
the first thing he&rsquo;d do would be to take him
to that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! and then all we&rsquo;ve got to do,&rdquo; broke
in the delighted Blake, who was hardly able to
keep from dancing on his tiptoes, such was
his increasing happiness, &ldquo;is to get a detail of
the guardsmen, and go there to arrest the
whole bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;s our move,&rdquo; admitted
Hugh, &ldquo;though we mustn&rsquo;t be too fast about
carrying it out. The whole night is before
us, you know. They won&rsquo;t hurt Felix, if our
theory is correct. All they want to do is to
keep him out of our reach for twenty-four
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we ought to see Captain Barclay again,
hadn&rsquo;t we, Hugh?&rdquo; questioned Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be our wisest move,&rdquo; agreed
the patrol leader, &ldquo;because we&rsquo;ll need some help
to round up those rascals; and it can only be
gotten through an order signed by our friend,
the artillery captain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;No sleep for me tonight, I wager,&rdquo; said
Blake; but somehow he seemed to glory in the
fact rather than put on a doleful expression.
Action meant a fresh possibility for a successful
ending of his search.</p>
<p>Hugh looked around him. The camp of the
guardsmen still presented a wonderfully fascinating
picture in his eyes, even though some
of the tired militiamen had sought their tents
in order to try and get a little sleep, having had
their rest broken more or less since leaving
their widely separated homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the captain heading this way now!&rdquo;
exclaimed Bud, with sudden zeal. &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
we had better tackle him while we have the
chance, Hugh. He&rsquo;s got a heap of camp duties
to look after, and, according to military rules,
they&rsquo;d have to take precedence above any private
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then, and we&rsquo;ll start the ball rolling,&rdquo;
the scout master agreed.</p>
<p>When Captain Barclay saw his trio of boy
friends from Oakvale heading toward him, he
smiled amiably, and nodded his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any good news, boys?&rdquo; he immediately
asked, showing that he still remembered about
their mission; &ldquo;heard of Felix Gregory anywhere,
and was he visiting in some other part
of the camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, nothing can be learned about him
from any of the men,&rdquo; replied Hugh, and then
immediately adding: &ldquo;Our chum here, Bud
Morgan, happened to learn something that we
believe may offer a strong clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, then,&rdquo; the officer commanded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very interested in the result of
your noble mission; and this strange disappearance
of an enlisted man from camp is
bothering some of us. I haven&rsquo;t mentioned it
to any one higher up, but was just thinking of
seeing the general about it. Things like that
reflect upon the management of a military
camp, where it is expected that discipline governs
every movement, so that it would appear
to be impossible for a single individual to drop
out. Now proceed, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh told the story, giving Bud due honors
for having made the wonderful discovery
that Luther Gregory was hovering near by,
evidently bent on sharing some of the foul work
with the man whom his money had hired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Captain Barclay asked several sharp questions.
It could be seen that he was intensely
interested. Bud made haste to enlighten him
on the points that did not appear to be quite
clear in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say, Hugh,&rdquo; he finally remarked,
decisively, &ldquo;things begin to look promising.
The chances are ten to one that if
Felix has been coaxed or smuggled out of the
camp here, he was taken to that lonely house
on the road. I believe I can remember noticing
the place as we passed from the station
this afternoon, where I went to look after some
additional baggage that had been shipped by
rail from the home town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll help us, won&rsquo;t you, Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will, to the full extent of my
power,&rdquo; came the hearty response, &ldquo;though before
anything can really be done in the matter
I must have a talk with my commanding officer
at Headquarters. Fortunately there
seems to be nothing of moment to demand my
attention. So, if you will once more wait for
me here, I&rsquo;ll see the general again. He was interested
in you before, after I had told him
some things I knew, and how Oakvale held
the scouts in such high esteem.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I hope he agrees to let you help us
surround that house, and see if Felix is held
a prisoner there,&rdquo; remarked Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the slightest doubt about the
ultimate outcome,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;so far as
the general&rsquo;s co-operation goes. Whether we
find your cousin there or not is another thing;
but I believe the chances are fairly good.
Look for me inside of half an hour, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he hastened away, turning his
back upon his comfortable tent with its inviting
camp cot, which must have appealed
strongly to a tired soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour he said, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; sighed
Blake. &ldquo;Gee whiz! that&rsquo;s a whole thirty long
minutes. It&rsquo;ll seem like a week to me, I guess.
But what&rsquo;s the use looking a gift horse in the
mouth. I ought to be thanking my lucky stars
that there&rsquo;s such a bully chance ahead. I&rsquo;m
going to quit grumbling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you expect he meant by saying
the general was interested in us as scouts,
Hugh?&rdquo; asked Bud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! just what he explained by telling us
he&rsquo;d mentioned some of the things we Oakvale
scouts had hung up to our credit,&rdquo; the patrol
leader answered. &ldquo;I suppose there are few
troops in the East that can point with pride to
a record like ours. We&rsquo;ve been a whole lot
lucky to have such chances to do things come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a time like this,&rdquo; Bud continued, a look
of satisfaction covering his face, &ldquo;it certainly
does make a fellow feel good to know he hasn&rsquo;t
any reason to be ashamed of his past record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I saw a soldier stop the captain and
salute, after which he handed him something,&rdquo;
Blake burst out with, excitedly. &ldquo;Now Captain
Barclay is pointing straight toward us,
boys; and see, he&rsquo;s handed the thing back again.
Looks to me as if he had ordered him to deliver
the same to us. I wonder what under the sun
it can be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; advised Bud, &ldquo;because
here comes the soldier; and by the same token
it&rsquo;s Burch Shafter, Hugh, whom you got to
join the battery after convincing his mother it
was a duty he owed his country.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>They watched the man in uniform approach
them with growing interest. It struck the
scouts as having some sort of connection with
their mission in the mobilization camp. Perhaps
the young fellow was bringing them fresh
news&mdash;Blake even began to speculate upon the
most improbable things, to the extent of wondering
whether this might not be some audacious
communication from Luther Gregory
telling him that his quest would be fruitless,
and that he might just as well return to Oakvale,
since he could not find Felix within the
given time.</p>
<p>Then the artilleryman arrived. Young
Shafter recognized them all, and he looked
particularly at Hugh with a gleam of affection
in his eyes, because the scout master had been
mainly instrumental in getting his mother&rsquo;s
consent to his enlistment. Nevertheless, he
made a stiff military salute upon first arriving,
and then dropped his hand at his side &ldquo;at attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! that doesn&rsquo;t go among old friends,
Burch,&rdquo; chuckled Bud. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s watching
you now, so you c&rsquo;n drop your camp manners,
and be sociable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>With that he clutched the other&rsquo;s hand and
shook it. The &ldquo;rookie&rdquo; laughed, and from that
moment became companionable. Hugh and
Blake in turn greeted him; for up to then they
had not chanced to run across young Shafter,
as he had been in another part of the camp,
possibly sent on official business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something was found in Felix Gregory&rsquo;s
tent, and they dispatched me with it to the captain,&rdquo;
he went on to explain. &ldquo;When he looked
it over he said Blake here ought to take charge
of the same, and so I&rsquo;m turning it over to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Blake glanced at the object that was
placed in his hand he gave a cry of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Hugh, Bud!&rdquo; he commenced to
say, deeply moved, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a letter written by Felix,
and sealed; and, would you believe it, the
same is directed to Uncle Reuben. Oh! I wonder
now did Felix repent of his own accord of
those ugly things he said in his hasty temper,
and write to apologize? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a
great thing, though, and a bully ending of the
whole silly affair?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE SEARCH SQUAD</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hasty about opening that letter,
Blake,&rdquo; cautioned the scout master, who saw
that such a move was indeed contemplated by
his chum.</p>
<p>Blake held his hand before he had started
to tear an end off the sealed envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought it would be only right to
find out if Felix had said he was sorry, Hugh,&rdquo;
he hastened to explain, looking somewhat disappointed.
&ldquo;Because if things did turn out
that way, you see I could get this letter to Uncle
Reuben, and then the object of our run up
here to camp would be accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand all that, Blake,&rdquo; answered
the other, quietly, &ldquo;but we mustn&rsquo;t forget
that a seal should be considered inviolate,
and a letter like this not opened except as a
last resort. He hadn&rsquo;t mailed it, and might
reconsider writing the same, no matter what
the contents are. Then, again, you can&rsquo;t be
sure that he did repent, and was wanting Uncle
Reuben to forgive him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake gave a big sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right about that, Hugh,&rdquo;
he admitted, reluctantly, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;d certainly
like to see what&rsquo;s inside of this the worst kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better let Hugh keep it in his pocket,&rdquo; suggested
Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means that maybe I might yield to
a strong temptation and slit the envelope open
some time or other,&rdquo; Blake remarked, quickly.
&ldquo;Well, it might be just as good that I didn&rsquo;t
have the chance, so here, you keep it, Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, the patrol leader took the letter
addressed to Mr. Reuben Gregory at Oakvale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how we&rsquo;ll settle this thing,&rdquo; he
proposed, thinking it best to have it decided,
and wishing to give poor Blake what measure
of comfort he could; &ldquo;suppose we say we&rsquo;ll
leave the letter unopened until nine tomorrow
morning. Then, if nothing comes from our
hunt for your cousin tonight, and the mystery
of his disappearance is still unexplained, why,
I&rsquo;ll take chances and we&rsquo;ll see what he wrote.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Hugh,&rdquo; agreed Blake, instantly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about as good a programme as we
could arrange. Still, we have all admitted that
it looks promising that Felix went to the
trouble of writing a letter to Uncle Reuben,
Something must have been worrying him&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
heard from one of his comrades here
that he hasn&rsquo;t been himself ever since the battery
left Oakvale. It was an uneasy conscience,
I&rsquo;m sure; I know Felix pretty well,
and I&rsquo;m certain that if he began to believe he
had acted in a mean way he would get no peace
of mind until he had done all in his power to
rectify his error.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Blake was in a decidedly &ldquo;chipper&rdquo;
frame of mind since this last odd happening.
He seemed to feel that things were finally
working out to serve their ends, and that success
must soon perch on their banner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked the philosophical Bud,
&ldquo;nothing like having two strings to your bow,
I&rsquo;ve always believed. Never put all your eggs
in one basket. Now, in case our little excursion
along the road to the railway station turns
out a complete failure, you see we&rsquo;ve always
got this letter to turn to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;And, of course,&rdquo; added Blake, &ldquo;when the
time limit has expired those men won&rsquo;t bother
trying to hold poor Felix any longer. They&rsquo;ll
believe their game is won, and turn him loose.
Now, just ten minutes have dragged by since
Captain Barclay left us, and he said half an
hour, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was like so much Greek to young
Shafter, and, seeing the look of bewilderment
on his face, Hugh took pity on him. Besides,
since the story was getting to be in general circulation
through devious channels, one guardsman
taken into their confidence would not matter.
Then, again, the telling might serve to
kill a little of the time that promised to hang
so heavily on their hands.</p>
<p>Accordingly he started in to entertain Burch
Shafter with a remarkable story that held his
attention closely all the way through. Hugh
was not the one to waste words, and so he kept
&ldquo;hewing close to the line&rdquo; until he had arrived
at the point where they were waiting for Captain
Barclay to return with permission from
Headquarters to take a detail of armed men
and ascertain who the inmates of that old
house on the roadside were; likewise, whether
Private Gregory were detained there against
his will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;All I can say,&rdquo; remarked the deeply interested
listener, after the stirring account of
their adventures on the road had been brought
to a finish, &ldquo;is that it beats the Dutch how
you scouts do have thrilling happenings come
your way. Why, there&rsquo;s a list as long as my
arm of fine things you fellows have done. Here
you promise to add another laurel to the
wreath you&rsquo;ve won. I take off my hat to Hugh
Hardin and the boys of Oakvale Troop. They
are trump cards, every one of them, and that&rsquo;s
the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered he was a soldier,
and that his time could not be called his own;
so, saying a hasty good-bye, Burch Shafter
strode away. His coming, and what he had
brought with him, had given them all new reasons
for gratitude, and the rainbow of promise
was once more shining brilliantly in the
heavens above.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The time dragged horribly after that, although
they talked of many things, so that
Blake might not give way to impatience. There
was a never-ending source of delight in just
glancing around them at all the queer sights by
which they found themselves surrounded, with
veterans and rookies carrying on a multitude
of camp duties. Had it been in the daytime instead
of about nine o&rsquo;clock at night, doubtless
the visitors would have witnessed a multitude
of intensely interesting things, such as are
born of camp life, from comrades being shaved
by fresh barbers, to others engaged in taking
their first lesson in the art of washing their
own clothes under very primitive conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, when Blake had sighed for about the
hundredth time, and Bud himself took to yawning
because of the inaction, Hugh announced
that he believed he had seen an officer hurrying
in their direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m greatly mistaken, it&rsquo;s our friend
the captain,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is, and no mistake,&rdquo; chuckled Bud;
while Blake drew in a long breath that spelled
relief because his &ldquo;watchful waiting&rdquo; period
was over.</p>
<p>As the officer approached they took new hope
upon seeing the look spread upon his face.
Surely he would not smile so broadly if he were
bringing them bad news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, boys, all right,&rdquo; he told them,
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the general has given permission for
us to carry out the scheme, has he, sir?&rdquo; asked
Hugh, greatly pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to take charge of it personally,
and leave no stone unturned to ascertain how
Private Gregory could be taken out of the
camp undetected; also to bring before him
those guilty of the outrage, if they could be
caught. That house, it seems, comes within
the boundaries of the camp, and hence any one
living there, or occupying the premises, is
amenable to military discipline and rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if by good luck we trap that schemer
and good-for-nothing Luther Gregory,&rdquo; exclaimed
Blake, rubbing his hands in joy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
going to be hard for him because he&rsquo;s interfered
with the liberty of one of Uncle Sam&rsquo;s
recruits? Well, I guess on the whole he&rsquo;ll get
only what he deserves, and I&rsquo;ll be glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going with us, Captain?&rdquo; asked
Bud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I shall take a detail of men, so
as to make doubly sure,&rdquo; explained the officer,
as though he had mapped out his plan of campaign,
like a wise soldier, as he came along.
&ldquo;The moon will soon be rising, and we may get
some benefit of her light, though that does not
matter much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was told about the letter, and seemed to
feel a good deal like Hugh in that it had better
not be opened, save as a last resort. If other
things failed them, and no signs of the missing
Felix could be found, then it would be time
enough to think of breaking the seal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he went on to say, particularly
directing the words toward Blake, whom
he guessed had been the one desirous of reading
the letter, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s always a mean feeling
comes on any one when you open a sealed envelope
surreptitiously. It&rsquo;s like a thief breaking
into a house in the night; you think you&rsquo;re
doing something you ought to be ashamed of,
no matter how good your motives really are.
So better let that rest until all other hope has
been abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Bud, &ldquo;and even at noon tomorrow
we could telegraph to Uncle Reuben we
were on the road with a letter of apology, and
he&rsquo;d be only too willing to wait for us to arrive
before changing his will. I reckon the old gentleman
would be only too glad of a chance to
meet a compromise halfway, if he thinks as
much of Felix as Blake Merton here tells us
he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come with me over to the
camp of the aviation boys,&rdquo; said Captain Barclay.
&ldquo;I have authority to enlist anyone I
please in the squad we shall take with us for
duty, and that being the case it might be just as
well to have that party along who told you
about Luther Gregory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnston was his name, Captain,&rdquo; explained
Bud, &ldquo;and I reckon he&rsquo;s some punkins
of an aeroplane pilot, too, because he&rsquo;s been
giving daring exhibitions in lots of county
fairs down South last winter. From what he
said, I reckon Johnston will be glad to be in
the bunch, because things are getting kind of
stale for him here, with so little material to
work with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain left them for a short time.
When he came back, three men carrying guns
followed at his heels. Blake surveyed their
armament with considerable interest, as though
convinced by this time that the clouds were
gathering around the devoted heads of the two
schemers who must soon find themselves in the
toils.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the moon just peeping above the
horizon, you see, boys,&rdquo; the captain remarked,
as he joined the waiting trio of scouts. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t more than ten o&rsquo;clock, either, and we
needn&rsquo;t be in any hurry. Let&rsquo;s head across to
where the aviation squad have their quarters,
so as to pick up Johnston, the air pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were proceeding along, the clear
notes of a bugle ascended from some point
close by, and never would Hugh and his chums
forget the peculiar effect produced upon them
when, for the first time, they heard &ldquo;taps&rdquo;
sounded in a military camp while the grim
shadow of impending war was hovering over
the land. It seemed to thrill them through and
through with its significance, for they could
not help remembering how it is this same sweet
sad call that is invariably given over the grave
of a soldier when his comrades bury him with
full military honors.</p>
<p>When they finally arrived at the border of
the camp, where lay the field that was to be
devoted to such aviation work as could be carried
on with the poor material on hand, Captain
Barclay immediately sought the officer in
command of the squad, whom he chanced to already
know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>He found no trouble in securing permission
to have the air pilot Johnston join them,
though, doubtless, the other wondered much
what it all meant, for there was no time to enter
into full explanations. Captain Barclay
did promise to see him on the next day, and
tell him an interesting story connected with the
visit of these three scouts from his home town.</p>
<p>Johnston recognized Bud, and readily agreed
to lead the little expedition to the house where
he had seen his old associate in aeronautics,
Luther Gregory. As he had, it may be remembered,
heard pretty much the whole story of
the adventure from Bud Morgan&rsquo;s lips, at the
time the other was coaxing him to tell the location
of the house where he claimed to have
seen Luther, the aviator did not express any
surprise, only satisfaction that his services had
been thought worth while securing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>There being nothing else to detain them now,
the captain gave the order for marching, and
the little company started forth. A sentry on
the border of the great camp challenged, and
demanded the password, which Captain Barclay
whispered in his ear; and so with the last
obstacle to their progress removed they began
to follow the road that led to the railway station,
possibly four miles away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">THE HOUSE BY THE ROADSIDE</span></h2>
<p>When Bud Morgan glanced back over his
shoulder just as they struck the road and were
well launched on their night tramp, he could
not help thinking what a wonderful sight it
was that greeted his admiring eyes. Bud had
always been a great hand for drinking in
scenes that were uncommon, and had been
known to temporarily forget that he was engaged
in a running match, when from the top
of a rise a vista of unusual beauty burst upon
his vision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>The battered old moon was above the horizon
now, and lay low in the east. A myriad
of camp fires flickered through the broad valley
where the State guardsmen were encamped,
waiting to be sworn into the service of Uncle
Sam, and entrain for the distant border. All
sorts of murmurous sounds came floating to
the ear, and formed a medley never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Bud, finding that the others were fast leaving
him in the lurch, hastened to catch up with
his chums; but he knew he would carry that
wonderful picture in memory as long as he
lived. The very mention of a mobilization
camp would make him think of the soft dab
of yellow in the sky marking the rising moon,
the glittering patches scattered about that
looked like giant fireflies; and the murmuring
sound of many voices, braying of mules, and
kindred camp notes.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;taps&rdquo; had sounded, and all this would
presently die away, for strict military regulations
governed the uniformed community.</p>
<p>Bud found a place alongside Blake, while
Hugh strode on with Captain Barclay and the
aviator guide, Johnston. It was perfectly natural
that the two boys should desire to communicate
while on the way. Blake in particular
wanted to find certain things, and as he
could bend his head close to that of his comrade,
before they had been three minutes on the
road in company, he was whispering:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bud, would you mind if I asked you something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course not, Blake,&rdquo; replied the
other in a soft tone, &ldquo;only be careful how you
speak. Remember that we&rsquo;re under the captain&rsquo;s
orders now, and he told us not to say
anything louder than a whisper. So fire
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No doubt Bud understood how very anxious
the other must be, for Blake had far more at
stake in the successful outcome of their adventure
than either of his companions, hence
the willingness of Bud to accommodate him;
for Blake was a pretty decent sort of fellow,
as boys go, and well liked by the Oakvale
Troop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I only wanted to ask if you could give
any kind of guess what the programme is going
to be after we get to that lonely house by
the road?&rdquo; Blake asked, showing that, after
all, it was more a desire to receive some comforting
assurance than a hope for knowledge
that actuated him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! shucks! how c&rsquo;n I tell that, Blake?&rdquo;
protested the other. &ldquo;Just as like as not we&rsquo;ll
first of all throw a loop around the old shanty,
so nobody c&rsquo;n skip out, and then start in to
comb it from attic to cellar. All I&rsquo;m hoping
is that they don&rsquo;t think to carry Felix further
away in that little flivver car, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! say, Bud, d&rsquo;ye know that&rsquo;s just what&rsquo;s
been bothering me right along,&rdquo; admitted
Blake. &ldquo;Everything hinges on our finding
that bunch hiding at the house alongside the
road. I wish we were there, so we&rsquo;d know
the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Blake,&rdquo; said Bud, encouragingly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a hunch that it&rsquo;s all going to come
off gilt-edged. Show your colors, old fellow,
and don&rsquo;t forget that a scout can keep his fears
under control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that Blake fell quiet. Perhaps he realized
that it was foolish to give way to these
doubts, just as Bud meant to imply. Silently
the little detachment advanced along the road,
the four armed soldiers bringing up the rear.
Once they were challenged, for videttes had
been posted even outside the limits of the big
military camp, since strict army rules prevailed,
and in a hostile country this would be
the practice. The captain, however, gave the
password in the ear of the man who suddenly
challenged them, and they were permitted to
move along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>After this had kept up for possibly fifteen
minutes, the boys knew they must be close upon
the object of their search. Johnston had, in
the beginning, said it was less than two miles
away, and hence, at any moment now, they
might expect to hear a low command to halt,
after which the captain would give directions
governing their future movements.</p>
<p>Eagerly, Blake was straining his eyes in
hopes of discovering some sort of house
ahead. More than once he thought he had hit
upon it, only to find, upon drawing near, that
a clump of trees formed the dark shadow patch
upon which his gaze had settled.</p>
<p>But all things must have an end, and in due
time the guide of the expedition signified that
they were now within stone&rsquo;s throw of their
destination. The captain beckoned them to
gather around him, after which in whispers he
designated every one&rsquo;s part in the venture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>The four privates were to circle the house,
guarding every exit, whether this be a door or
window. Their orders were to hail first, and
then, if the fleeing party refused to halt, to
shoot, though trying to &ldquo;pepper&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s
legs rather than mortally injure him.</p>
<p>As for the three scouts, they were to accompany
the captain and Johnston, whose intention
it was to enter the building and arrest the
inmates.</p>
<p>When Blake heard this he fairly quivered
with an excess of emotion and zeal. He was
only too delighted at such a chance to be &ldquo;in
at the death,&rdquo; as he mentally termed it. How
good it was of their friend the captain to allow
them this privilege. Most army officers
would have considered boys a nuisance, and,
doubtless, ordered them to stay back until
things had shaped themselves, and the danger
was past; but then Captain Barclay lived
in Oakvale, and knew just how bravely the
scouts had carried themselves on numberless
occasions.</p>
<p>All of them could see the house, for they
were creeping forward again. It happened to
be upon the side of the road where the low-lying
moon&rsquo;s rays did not fall, so that the
shadows were fairly dense; but sharp eyes
could make it out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Blake was glad to notice that all seemed as
still as death around the place. So far as he
could see, there was no sign of a light visible.
If the inmates were awake and burning a lamp,
they must have first carefully drawn the
shades, and otherwise darkened the windows,
for try as Blake might, he failed to detect even
a narrow shaft of illumination.</p>
<p>A near-panic gripped the boy&rsquo;s rapidly beating
heart. He feared that those they sought
might not be at the roadhouse&mdash;that when the
man in the flivver had arrived with Felix in his
car they may have continued the flight, and by
this time were many miles away.</p>
<p>However, Blake&rsquo;s fright was of short duration.
He remembered what Bud had said
about mastering himself, and thus managed
to get a firm grip on his weak heart.</p>
<p>Great care was taken while advancing to
keep well in the shadow. Although everything
seemed so still about the place, there was no
telling whether the suspected inmates of the
house were on guard or not. For all they knew,
hostile eyes might be peering out from some
crack, and ordinary caution required that they
take just as much pains as though they knew
this for a certainty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>By motions rather than even the lowest of
words the captain stationed his four men. He
had evidently planned his every move, and
there was to be no hitch that would imperil the
success of the enterprise.</p>
<p>When the armed guards had been placed,
the next thing was to approach the door and
knock. Blake again had a chilly feeling attack
as he realized that the crisis was now at
hand, when success or failure would follow.
If repeated knocking went without any response,
the chances were the house had been
abandoned, and that they would have had all
their trouble for their pains. Of course,
though, Blake told himself, they would give
the place a thorough overhauling, so as to
make sure those they sought were not hiding.</p>
<p>Well, there was one comfort that appealed
to him. This lay in the letter which Felix had
written, and now in the possession of Hugh
Hardin. If the worst came they could open
that, and always have a chance that it would
be what they wanted, an apology meant for
Uncle Reuben&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>The captain had stepped boldly up to the
door. Blake saw him place his ear close to
the panels, after trying the knob and finding
that a key had been turned in the lock, for
the door refused to open. If Captain Barclay
detected the least sign of human occupancy, he
gave no indication of it; but he did knock
loudly with his knuckles.</p>
<p>Everybody listened intently. The four uniformed
guards had been cautioned to keep out
of sight, and the shadows engulfed them. Had
any one peered from a window he would have
been able to see nothing, unless in some manner
he managed to glimpse that little group
on the stone step before the door.</p>
<p>But some person was certainly moving inside,
for even Blake heard sounds indicating
such a thing. The officer waited a minute,
and then again thumped lustily on the panel.
A glimmer of light was seen, telling them that
some one approached; then came the sound of
a key turned in the lock, after which the door
swung partly open, revealing a man standing
there, holding a lighted lamp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">A SUCCESSFUL ROUND-UP</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drop that lamp if you value your
life!&rdquo; called out Captain Barclay, as he immediately
covered the startled man with a
weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him, Captain&mdash;it&rsquo;s Luther Gregory!&rdquo;
shrilled Blake, forgetting that as the captain
lived in Oakvale he must also have known
the other in times gone by.</p>
<p>Luther Gregory it was for a fact, and Hugh,
upon discovering this, felt a wave of relief
rushing over him. He believed they were going
to meet with success in their undertaking,
and that all would come out well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this mean?&rdquo; exclaimed the man
who held the lamp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Hugh immediately started to relieve him of
the light, for he was afraid that a sudden
desperate move toward escape might be inaugurated
by the plotter dropping the lamp,
and causing either an explosion, or darkness
to cover the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that you are under arrest, Gregory,
charged with unlawfully taking an enlisted
man out of camp against his will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the captain summoned one of the
guards and placed him at the side of the prisoner.
When Luther Gregory saw this he
laughed and shrugged his shoulders after the
fashion of a reckless man who, having played
for high stakes, sees his castles in the air falling
in ruins, and cares little what becomes of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the game is up, is it?&rdquo; he called out.
&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t hear a squeal from me. I
haven&rsquo;t done anything so terrible that the Government,
or the State, either, can hold me for
it. Coaxing an enlisted man to desert might
seem a crime, but inviting him to visit you, and
spend the evening is another. You can&rsquo;t prove
a thing against me, try as hard as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that later on,&rdquo; said the officer,
grimly. &ldquo;Meanwhile we&rsquo;ll take a look
through this house, and make the acquaintance
of your confederate in crime. Come with me,
boys; fetch him in also, Private Fielder, and
keep a tight hold on his arm. Remember you
are at liberty to shoot if he tries to break
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so great a fool as to take such
chances, Captain,&rdquo; the other told him.</p>
<p>When from the hall they stepped into the
adjoining room Blake gave utterance to a low
cry of mingled concern and joy, for the very
first thing his eyes discovered was a figure
lying on a cot. He flew across the apartment
and bent down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Felix, boys, sure it is my cousin!&rdquo; he
called out. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, Felix? Oh!
Hugh, what ails him, do you think? See how
he stares at me, just as if he didn&rsquo;t recognize
me one bit. Is he sick, Hugh; or have those
men done something to make him act so
queerly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scout master knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ve given him some sort of
drug, Blake,&rdquo; he went on to say, laying a hand
on Blake&rsquo;s shoulder, for he realized that the
boy was terribly wrought up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s already
recovering, and will be himself soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the truth, Gregory?&rdquo; demanded the
captain, harshly frowning upon the prisoner,
who, however, was too clever to commit himself
so early in the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the fact is,&rdquo; he remarked, airily, with
a light laugh, &ldquo;Cousin Felix commenced to act
strangely soon after coming here to visit me.
I thought he was going to have a fit, and
coaxed him to lie down there as you see. He
is getting better, though, and will be himself
before very long. But his mind is apt to be
clouded, more or less; and I shouldn&rsquo;t be much
surprised if he even got it into his silly head
to think I had something to do with his leaving
the camp, and coming here to visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Barclay understood what the sly
schemer was aiming to do. He smiled in a
satirical way, and then remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not be able to hoodwink the eyes of
a judge and jury when you&rsquo;re placed on trial
for this nasty business, Gregory. You&rsquo;ve
played a high hand, but this time you&rsquo;re going
to get your reward, and see the inside of a
State&rsquo;s prison. But let&rsquo;s take a look around,
and see what&rsquo;s become of your accomplice; for
since I noticed his little car drawn under a shed
back of the house, I take it he must still be
somewhere around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>At that Hugh and Bud began to take fresh
interest in the case, though Blake apparently had
eyes only for his cousin, over whom he was
bending, trying to hold the attention of Felix
by continual talking. The scout instinct was
strong in the makeup of the two lads, and no
sooner had the captain suggested a hunt to
find the missing tool of the arch schemer than
they began to use their eyes in searching out
every possible place where a small man might
conceal himself in an emergency.</p>
<p>They had good reason to feel anything but
kindly disposed toward that man of the flivver.
Not only did he curtly decline to assist
them when they had engine trouble, but had
afterwards done everything in his power to
hold them up on the way to camp. The memory
of the country constable who believed them
to be thieves running away with a car they
had taken, as well as what happened at the
burning bridge, were things not calculated to
make them feel very friendly toward the unscrupulous
man who had been responsible for
these various happenings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Hugh noticed almost immediately that while
there was no blaze in the big open fireplace,
there did seem to be an unusual amount of
soot on the hearth. This must have given him
his cue, for he stepped forward, bent down, and
tried to see up the wide-throated chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything up there, Hugh?&rdquo; asked
Bud, close at his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at my face and tell me if you see little
patches of black on it?&rdquo; demanded the scout
master, turning his head to his comrade for
examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what there are, Hugh!&rdquo; exclaimed the
other, joyfully, &ldquo;which announces the fact that
<i>somebody</i> is up there in that chimney. How&rsquo;ll
you get Mr. Coon to come down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, please lend me your revolver,&rdquo;
said Hugh, in a loud voice, purposely intended
to pass up the chimney flue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got six cartridges
in the chambers hasn&rsquo;t it, Captain?
Well, they ought to be enough to fetch him
down, dead or alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly there came a half-muffled groan,
and then following an appeal:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on please, don&rsquo;t shoot! I&rsquo;m coming
down just as fast as I can. Oh! I&rsquo;m nearly
choked to death with the soot up here. Wait
for me, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>More black stuff came down in a shower.
Hugh stepped back, and with a grin on his
face, Bud followed suit. They heard considerable
scratching and puffing from inside the
chimney, after which there came a thud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what is it?&rdquo; gasped Bud as he stared
at a dusky object that huddled there on the
open hearth amidst the piles of soot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; piped up a half strangled voice.
&ldquo;Jones is my name, Pliny Jones, and, as usual,
playing in tough luck. I&rsquo;ll turn State&rsquo;s evidence,
gentlemen, if you can promise me immunity.
But what I want most of all just
now is a plain drink of water, because I&rsquo;m
choking horribly. Please accommodate a poor
wretch, one of you boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud could not resist the appeal, though he
was quivering with half suppressed laughter,
for it was decidedly comical to see what a sight
the small owner of the flivver had made of
himself by crowding into the recesses of the
chimney&mdash;a negro could not have been any
blacker, Bud felt sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>By slow degrees Felix seemed to be coming
out of his stupor. He had already managed to
recognize Blake Merton, though it was hard
for him to realize just where he was, and what
had happened to him. In fact, his mind was always
in somewhat of a haze concerning the
events of the last few hours.</p>
<p>He later on remembered being spoken to by
the small man in the car, who had found a
way to enter the camp. The other had whispered
to him that he was the bearer of an
important message from his Uncle Reuben;
and as Felix just then was mourning the recent
unfortunate break with his guardian, he gave
a ready ear to a request to join the other at
a certain spot outside the limits of the camp,
knowing he could get permission to go there.</p>
<p>He also remembered being told to lean forward,
and take a look at some paper held by
the other, and that a sudden vertigo seized
him as a handkerchief was clapped over his
face. After that it was all vague, although he
believed he had been stowed away in the small
car, and driven a short distance, and only now
to awaken from a dream to find Blake there.
Some strange things taking place puzzled
him greatly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>It was difficult to believe that such a kidnaping
could actually have taken place, and yet
the evidence of it lay before them. The captain
had the two prisoners taken away, to be
confined in the guard house until morning,
when he expected to put their case in the hands
of the commanding general, who, being a lawyer
himself, would know what to do with them,
so that they might be made to suffer for their
miserable work.</p>
<p>Felix, having recovered in part, was taken
in the small car to camp, the scouts following
after with Johnston the aviator, from whom
Bud picked up many hints as they strode along.</p>
<p>Later on that same night Hugh, Blake and
Bud gathered in a tent with the genial captain,
who was, of course, deeply interested in their
affairs, and anxious to see the outcome.</p>
<p>Felix was also present, having by that time
fully recovered from his recent adventure,
though still pale. Here the story was gone
over again, in order that the two listeners
might get a full comprehension of the facts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>They seemed to be deeply interested as the
recital progressed, now one of the trio taking
it upon himself to do the explaining, and then
another, until in the end everything had been
made clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Hugh, in conclusion, when
they had come down to the place where the
capture of the schemers was effected at the
roadside house, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the letter they found
in your tent, Felix, addressed to Uncle Reuben,
and which you evidently meant to mail in the
morning. Blake was crazy to open it, and see
how you felt toward your guardian, but I held
him back,&mdash;although we would have had to do
it in case we failed to find you by noon tomorrow.
You can do as you please about showing
us what you wrote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felix never hesitated a moment, but, tearing
an end from the envelope, handed the enclosure
to the scout master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it out loud, please, Hugh,&rdquo; he said
simply, yet with a gleam of pride and satisfaction
in his voice and manner.</p>
<p>Hugh hastened to do as he was told. The
letter proved to be long, and need not be given
here, but it was certainly just what might have
been expected from a quick tempered lad like
Felix, who often said things hastily, and then
bitterly repented of them afterwards. Hugh
knew that Uncle Reuben would treasure that
manly apology as a most precious document.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Felix; couldn&rsquo;t be better!&rdquo;
cried Blake, seizing the young guardsman&rsquo;s
hand and wringing it enthusiastically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
going to give me that letter, sealed in another
envelope and addressed to Uncle Reuben.
Then first thing in the morning I&rsquo;ll get him on
the &rsquo;phone and tell him all about it, so his mind
will be easy in case anything prevents us from
getting back home by tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was all arranged. The captain joined
in congratulating Felix over the successful outcome
of his escapade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope this will be a lesson to you, my boy,
all your life,&rdquo; he told him, seriously, as became
a commanding officer, &ldquo;and that you&rsquo;ll learn to
bridle your tongue. Lots of trouble is caused
in this world by people saying things they&rsquo;re
sure to regret afterwards. But let me tell
you, Felix, you owe all your present condition
of liberty and happiness to these bright and
bustling scout friends of yours. Once more
Oakvale has reason to be proud of her boys;
and I mean that the story of this trip to the
mobilization camp isn&rsquo;t kept like a light hidden
under a bushel. Others ought to hear about
such praiseworthy work, in order that they
may emulate the example set by Hugh and his
two chums.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The good captain would not hear of the
scouts leaving the camp that night. They
could occupy a spare tent that he was only too
happy to offer them. The arrangement made
with the commanding general would answer
for this; and, besides, in the morning he
wanted them to meet the &ldquo;head boss&rdquo; of the
camp, who must hear the story of their late
adventures, for it happened that he had boys
of his own who belonged to a troop, and the
general was deeply interested in all that concerned
scout activities.</p>
<p>So we may leave Hugh and Bud and Blake
there, to get what sleep they could amidst such
strange surroundings. In thus saying goodbye
to the boys of the Oakvale Troop, however,
it is with the assurance that such active
fellows cannot rest long without engaging in
further ventures which will demand our attention,
and necessitate another volume to tell the
story of their successes.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
